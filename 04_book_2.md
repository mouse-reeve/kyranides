A.

{G} i. e. _a She-Goat, known to all,_ which
is also called the Oracle. For if a man
put a She-Goat's skin about one, _troubled
with the Falling Sickness,_ and lead him along
a River or the Sea-side, by and by he will
be taken falling and trembling, and in an
agony. _For People in bloody Fluxes;_ And
the Blood of a She-Goat heated over the
Fire and eaten, cures Dysenterick persons
_and effectually saves them, that have drank
poysonous potions, and perfectly cures people of the
Dropsie._ And the Gall applied with Honey
without dross _cures Dimness, Spech, and the
Pin and Web in the Eyes._ The Spleen also of a
She-goat roasted and eaten, cures the _bloody
Flux._ And its dry Dung drunk with wine
and honey _helps difficulty in Urine._ And its
Dung mixt with Pultesses, and spread upon
the Sores, _heals them that are stung with a Spider,
or Serpent, or a Prester._ And boiled in
old wine and applied, _it perfectly cures swellings
of the Limbs, and Genitals, and Breasts._
And mixt with Honey and melted and applied,
it _cures them, and draws out all Venom._
And the Spleen of a She-Goat taken fresh
and hot in the Name of the Patient, and
laid upon the Spleen _of one troubled with the
Spleen,_ and swathed on only one day, afterwards
taken off, then let the sick party hang
it in the Smoak, or Sun, or Wind; as much
as the Spleen of the She-Goat dries away,
so much will the Patient's Spleen waste. And
the Spleen of a Kid drunk _heals them that are
bitten by Serpents;_ And the Rennet of it
drank, or eaten roasted, _cures the Bloody
Flux_: And boyled with Galls and Olives
and eaten, _it stops the Flux of the Belly._ And
the Spleen of this Creature roasted and eaten,
_cures People of the Spleen._ Its Skin, burnt in
a Fume, _raises Lethargick people, and them
that fall in an Epilepsie, and them that have
Fits of the Mother._ And its Hair suffumigated
_does the same_.


B.

{G}, i.e. _a Cow, known to all._ Take the dry
Dung of this Creature, beat it, sift it, weigh
of it ℔j. Wax ℥vj. Cabbage Juice ℥vj. (or
in another Book iij.) raw Eggs iv. the best
Oyl ℔j. Beat what is to be beaten, melt what
is to be melted, put in the Eggs, and dissolve
all a little longer. _By this Plaster you
may cure the Spleen, Falling Sickness, Dropsie,
and such like, and also water Ruptures, and
the out._ Keep it secret, because it is a great
thing. And if you dissolve the Dung in Vinegar,
and anoint any place, or a _Vessel of
Honey with it, Ants will not creep up._ And
Cow Hoofs boyled, and eaten with Vinegar,
_resist all Poysons, nothing more._ And Cow's
Call _breaks the Corns o our Flesh and beautifies
the Face._ And its Dung suffumigated under
the Patient's Chair, _hastens the Birth, and
brings away the After-burthen._


B.

{G}, i.e. _a Frog, a well known Animal._
If one cuts its Tongue out, and let it go again
alive, and make a superscription upon
the Tongue thus, _XV Vox. chuoch, coja
MH yogi edammoth_, and shall lay it privately
upon a Woman, as she is asleep, _the
Woman will tell whatever she has done all her
Life time._ And the Ashes of a Frog, applied
in a Plaster with Pitch, thicken an _Alopecia_,
And applied with Vinegar, _they cure all bleeding
at the Nose, of Ulcers, and Women's Fluxes.
They also cure the Veins and Arteries, and Burns_
And if one take a Frog alive in the Name of
any one, when neither the Sun nor the Moon
is above the Earth, and shall cut off its two
hind feet with a pair of Scissors, and wrap it
in Deer's skin, and tie the right to the right
foot, and the left to the left, _he will cure
gouty persons without fail_. If any one would _cast
the hair of his whole Body_, let him burn the
skin of a Frog, and put it into the water of
the Bath, he will cast it. _For an Alopecia,
or falling of the hair_; Apply the ashes of little
Frogs with Tar, and you will cure an _Alopecia_.



## {G}

{G}, i.e. a _Weezle, a little Creature, known
to all._ A Weezle's Tongue dried, and worn
in ones shooes, _makes all his Enemies to be
mute._ Another Book says, _it amends Forgetfulness
and an ill Mind._ And if at any
time you find a Weezle thrown out dead, take,
and boyl it in Oyl, till it be dissolved, then
strain out the Oyl, and put as much Wax to
it as will make it into Plaster, _and you will
have a great Medicine for the Goat, and for all
Diseased of the nerves, and for Inflammations of
the Feet and Limbs, and for all Deflexions,
and it cured a bad King's Evil, and the Breasts,
and the Stones, and Apostemes, and it is good in
Chirurgery for Buboes._ The Stones help Conception,
and hinder Conception. For if any
one mix the right stone in a unguent, and
put it in a Pessary with wool, and use coition,
she will, as I said, _conceive presently_. But
the left Testicle tied up in a Mule's skin, and
carried about one, _hinders Conceptions_. These
words must be written in the Mule's skin,
_In Ora. i. idacvia. i. joa. Q. a_ viij. _i rayo. j. voi.
koox ʒ. i. coochi_. But if you will not believe
it, try it in a Hen, that lays eggs, and she
will not lay. And cut off its Testicles in the
wain of the Moon, and let it go again
alice, and give the Testicles to be carried in
a Mule's skin, _it is inconceptive, and invincible,
and amatory_. And save its Blood in Vinegar,
and give it secretly to one troubled with the
falling Sickness, till it is all gone, and it
perfectly cures.

## {G}{delta}

{G}, i.e. a _Roe-buck, is a four footed Animal,
having a conceptory virtue._ If therefore
you would have Conception to be strong
and infallible, do thus; Of Satyrion _i.e._ Satyrion
seed ℥iij. Mix, and put it up into a glass
vessel. And when there is occasion, give it
to a young Woman, when it is dry, and let
her use coition. And if you would conceive
a Male, take the hill of a Male Roe; if a Female,
the gall of a Female. For it is very
delectable. But if it be too dry, put as much
Honey to it, as shall be requisite.

## E.

{G} _is a Serpent, and it is a winding Animal,
known to all, a Viper._ And some take it
alive, and put it into a course earthen pot
with Salt, and set it in the Chimney night
and day, till it is dried; and then they mix
Spices with it, and give it for all Diseases.
_The Salt cures the Leprosie of the_ Greeks _and of
the_ Arabians, _the Gout, Falling Sickness, Palsie,
and all desperate diseases._ And Vipers Fat
_sharpens the sight, and all dulness of the Eyes._
And the Eyes hung about the neck, _cure all
inflammation of the Eyes_. And the Teeth are
_Good for the Tooth-ach, and make Children's
Teeth breed without pain._ And the Agate stone
fumigated drives away the Viper, and this
Stone drunk with Deer's Marrow cures the
biting of a Viper.

{G}, _Echidrius terrstris,_ i.e. _prickly Hog,
a Hedgehog, is a very naughty Animal._ When
you have catcht this, salt it and dry it, that
you may have a great Medicine. But throw
away the Gall, because it is bad. Its head
burnt, and applied with Honey _thickens an
Alopecia._ A little of the Body dried, and
given in Drink _cures Blasting, the Falling Sickness,
Palsie, Swimming in the Head, Head-ach,
and all Diseases of such Nature, and the Kidneys
also, and the Loins._ And oyu must give
℥i. (another Book has ʒj.) And its skin
burnt and powdered _cures an Alopecia_. And
you must pickle the whole Body and the _Viscera_,
like Pork in Salt, and dry it like Bacon:
Except the Gall and the Guts; then rub it
well and put it up. And give ℥i. of it to
drink in _Oxymel to Leprous and Dropsical Persons._
And in like manner also the Liver, and
Kidneys, and Heart, and Lungs dried, _cure
the same_.
