Letter I. A.

{G} the white Vine. {G}, the Eagle, a Bird. {G}, the Eagle-stone.
{G}, the Eagle, a Fish without Scales.

{G} is a molt holy and admirable Herb; it is also divine, and is called {G}, Bryony. The Male-Eagle is King of all Birds. The Eagle-stone is with Child and Rattles. The
Eagle, a Fish without Scales, is like the Hawkfish, only somewhat blacker, and like a little Thorn-back. For _Convulsions and Epilepsies_;
Now the Root of the Herb worn about the
Neck, cures People of Convulsions and the falling
Sickness. _For the bloody Flux, and spitting
of Blood_; And four Spoonfulls of the
Juice given to any in a bloody Flux cure him.
_Against Drunkenness_; And if a man, otherwise
well, have a mind to drink much Drink,
let him drink of the Juice of the Leaves ℥j.
and as much Vinegar fasting. _That one be
not made drunk_; And if one drink the Stone
that is in the Head of the Fish, with Wine,
he shall not perceive at all what he drinks.
And if he carry the Stone about his Neck,
without the Herb, if he drink a Gallon of
strong Wine, he shall not perceive it. _To
make Excretion_. The Stones, when the
Grapes are prest out, bruised with a little of
the said Stone, and given in Drink to such as
have paralytick Genitals, will make them stand.
And it is good for them that cannot perform
the Act of Generation. _For broken Bones of
the Hands, and bloody Fluxes, and any Disease
of the Arse. And GOD himself gave this, that
mortal Body might not fail._ Take of White
Wine a Pint and an half, with the tender
Buds of the Herb XL, and Coriars Galls ℥iij.
Boyl two thirds away; this cures Dysenteries
and Lienterics, and broken Bones of the hands,
and every Disease of the Arse, and every such
thing, if it be drunk. A Decoction of the
Leaves also, drunk with a little Honey, asswages
every Disease of the Neck: And if you
add a little of the Stone, that Disease will
neither encrease, nor return again. I have
seen several, who have had their Bones crushed,
and I admired how they were cured.
One can testifie this, who was twenty five
years old, and is now restored without pain
by this Divine Medicine and Nature: Nor
indeed were there any Hands before; all the
Flesh was withered upon one, nor had it any Sense;
but all the Members besides had
their feeling. _Also to make broken Bones whole,
I found in this Sacred Book thus:_ Give the
Juice of the Leaves of the Herb, and as much
white Wine mixt with it, to drink for seven
days. And the Eagle-Stone worn about one,
and the Fish eaten, do the same thing. _Keep
this Gist of GOD, and give it not to thine own
Son!_

_For the Thumbs and incurable Nails_:
When the Nail of the Thumb falls, and is incurable,
and is alwayes running, infuse Dates
bruised in white Wine, and lay them sometimes
on alone, chewed, and sometimes with
Oyl of Roses. _For Warts_: And for Warts,
which come either all over the Body, or in
any Part, burn the Branches or Wood of
Vine, and apply the Water that comes out
with the Smoak of the Vine-Leaf, or give it
to drink, and they will all fall off: _Teach
man this!_ So the Dung of an Eagle applied,
will cure: The Stone applied, and the Fat
of the Fish anointed, does also cure. _For
Putrefaction of the Gums, and the Jaws, and for
cancerous and eating Ulcers in the whole Body._
Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iij. Alum ℥iv.
crude _Misy_ ℥iv. Manna ℥iv. Illyrick Iris ℥j.
Vitriol ℥iv. dissolved till they be dry; for
this purges and fills ulcerous and eating Sores,
and it stops a supervening Inflammation. And
this is far greater.

_For Putrefaction of the
Tongue, and Mortification of the Gums_. But
now we tell you something that is great. We
saw something marcid and cancerous in the
Tongue, which was like also to mortifie the
Gums; therefore by applying the Juice of
the Leaves mixt with Honey, it was cured;
then strewing on dry _Iris_, the Ulcer filled
up. _For all Breaches, and a _Polypus_, and
Frettings, and Eatings, and Humors, and
whatever happens about the Nose, a Divine Medicine_.
Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iv. Manna,
Vitriol, Frankincense, _Misy_, _Aristolochia_,
each three ounces: Rub them till all is dry, and use the Divine Virtue.

_For Baldness and Shedding of the Hair, Sores, Scars, and any Diseases about the Head_:
Apple the Juice of the Herb and the Juice of _Potamogeiton_,
and the Juice of _Seseli_ skillfully mixt, anoynt for three days.

_A Divine Medicine to keep the Teeth sound and firm, which I would not keep from you_.
Of the Juice of the Grapes ℥j. or viii Spoonfulls, the Bark of Mulbery-Tree Root ℥vj.
Boyl it to half, and give it to wash the
Mouth for three or five or seven days, and
your Teeth will never ake. If one will diligently
consider, the Vine will cure all Diseases
from the Head to the Feet. This Herb
is called _THEOdorica_, i. e. _Given of GOD_.
_Kiranus_ and _Harpocration_ do thus far agree.

Then _Kiranus_ brings something new, and
says, _For Urine and Stool_; The Sprouts, I
say, of the first Budding of this Herb, boyled
and eaten, provoke Urine and Stool. But
both the Leaves, and the Root, and the Fruit
have a very hot and sharp Virtue. _For the
King's Evil, and eating Flesh, and putrid Ulcers
and Gangrenes_. And it has also another
very famous Virtue and Divine Efficacy; for
it cures the King's Evil, and putrid Ulcers and
Gangrenes, and eating Sores, made up with _Aristolochia_ into Plaster. And its Root rosted brings a good Colour into the Face, and a tender Skin. _And it takes out Moles, Corns, and Freckles; Mixt with Flower of bitter Vetch and Fœnugreek, it takes away Corns, Freckles and black Moles_. And boiled with Oyl till it congeals, it congeals, it is good for the same. And the Root broken in Wine, takes away Lividness of the Eyes and Whitlows. _For a Swelling_. It an ends any Ulcer of the Genitals, and dissipates and disperses Swellings. _For the Epilepsie_. An ounce of it given every day for a Year with _Oxymel_, cures it. _For the Apoplexy
and Swimming in the Head, and Biting of
Serpents, and Miscarriage_. It is also good for
Apoplectick and Vertiginous Persons: Give
(???), and it quickly cures such as are bitten by
Serpents; It corrupts the Birth also, and disturbs
the Belly and the Sense; and applied,
it brings away the Secundine, and drunk, it
moves Urine. Eighteen grains of it drunk
for thirty days, wastes the Spleen. Made into
a Plaster with Figs, it is good for the
same. It is boyled for hot Insessions for purging
of the _Matrix_. It also moderately purgeth
the Belly. And its Fruit in an Oyntment
and Plaster, is good for the Scurf and Leprosie.
The Juice of the Herb drunk in Broth,
causes Milk. Drunk and anointed with Oyl,
it is good for Epaticks. Its Leaves also in a
Cataplasm with Wine, are good for all Ulcers.
And applied, they are good for Rheumatick
Swellings. And we may say further,
_It is good for all things to him that useth it with
Caution._

And there are two sorts of it. The first is
called the white Vine, which some call Bryony,
others Snake-Grape; others Celidonia, others
{G} others {G}, others {G},
others Kethedron. The Buds, and Leaves,
and Claspers of this are like the Domestick
Vine, but they are thicker, and implicated
With the adjacent Fruits, catching with their
Claspers; and it has a red Grape-like Fruit,
wherewith Hides have their Hair fetcht off,
or are prepared. And the second sort of it
is called the _black Vine_, which they also call
Bryony; and some {G}, having Leaves
like Ivy, but the great ones like Bind-weed,
but greater; this also applies itself to, and
takes hold of Trees with its Clafpers. And its
Fruit is like Grapes; they are green in the
beginning, and when they are ripe, they are
black without, but like Box within. And its
Sprouts also at the first budding may be boyled
like Pot-herbs; and they are diuretick,
and force the _Menstrua_; they cure the Spleen.
The Roots are very good for Splenetick Persons,
and the whole Herb is proper for such
as are Epileptick and Vertiginous. And its
Leaf in a Cataplasm with Wine, is good to
eat away proud Flesh, and for wrested and
dislocated Limbs, and for Relaxations; and
further, it has a Virtue like to the former.

And the white Vine has other Efficacies
secular and delightful, so that being applied,
it does not only give any man Sobriety, but
causes Delight. _So says _Kiranus_ this place_,
After the Dissonance of them both, there began
_Harpocration_ his Speech: _O blessed Herb!
Conducter of the Gods, and a Royal Conducter,
more powerful than all Herbs, having the Principality of Earth, and
Heaven, and Air, and dissolving all Power! O Grape bearing Drink! maist thou loosen the Limbs, cause Sleep! No Speech nor Body shall expel thee; but thou findest out whatever things are in the Minds of Mortals, and what Mysteries they have hidden in their Mind. The Vine makes manifest all Secrets, and all things hat shall be concealed by Writing, or by Medicine, or by Enchantment, or by the Sword, or by Science: For these may be said to be the Mysteries of the Vine._ And it has other mundane things also which are not unprofitable to Mortals, yea they bring Delight and Joy. Therefor thus I read on: The holy Speech, as Kirani has it. _For Joy and Exultation._ O Blessed Queen bestowed of GOD, most holy Mother, and more Divine than all Plants! first Nature affects the Grape, the Grape makes heavenly wine! Before you have said this, send the Cup, Bowl or Flagon about, of which all do drink, and they break out in Joy, no man complaining or asking. For {G}, i. e. _Exultation_. The Juice of the Grape drunk causes great Joy. Plant it in every place. For neither the Solemnities of the Gods, nor of Mortals, who have a term in their Life; nor what things in Life do come, nor what things now go out, nor some of those things that are acted in Life, can be done without this Plant. Also occult things require planting of it._For people troubles with Quartane Agnes_; It yet remains for me to speak if the certain _Cacodemon_ (or evil Spirit) which is call'd a Quartanary, who is not easily conquered by five Fortitudes of the first Decan of _Capricorn_, because he sees not, nor hears, for he is without a Head. Therefore take the Grape having four Seeds, take out the Kernels with your Nails, and not with your
Mouth, and put them in a course Cloth, and hang them about your Neck, and it will cause Health. And the Stone that is in the Head of the Fish, hung about the Neck, takes away a Quartane. Therefore take the Eagle-Stone, and engrave also an Eagle upon it, and under the Stone put the Kernels of the Grape, and the top of the Feathers of an Eagles wing; and if you have not an Eagle, of an Hawks, and enclosing it, wear it. For it will preserve you from all the foresaid Occasions of Evil: Moreover it will give you power to speak, and to have friendly conferences with Great Men; and it is good for many other things; all which I will not declare.



LETTER II. Γ.

{G} is a Bird which is called {G} i. e. _a Crow_, a common Animal, and known to all People, living to five hundred years of age. {G} is a precious Stone, a Beril which is called {G} i. e. _All Life_. {G} is a _Sea-Lobster_, so called from its likeness to {G}, i. e. red Tiles. {G}, i. e. The Herb Sevine, known to all People.

_For Dyspnoïck (?), Orthopnoïck and Asthmatic Persons:_ Make this Electuary; Of Savine (???). Butter (???). Honey (???). Mix, and give it a fasting (tasting?). _For any Infirmity of the Eye_; Crab hung about the Neck, cure all Infirmities of the Eye. And the Bird hath the same Nature; for if the Female dies, the Male will not pair with another; and the Female does the same. _For Love between a Man and his Wife_. If a Man carry the Heart of a Male Crow, and a Woman the Heart of the Female, they will agree between themselves all their Life-time; and this Miracle is certain. _For Dyspnoïck, Epilseptick, and Nephritick People_. Take, I say, one Beril Stone and engrave a Crow upon it, and under its feet a Crab; enclose also a little Savine, and a little of the Heart of a Bird under the Stone, wear it as you will: for it is good for Dypsnoick, Epileptick and Nephritick Persons. _For Joy and Exultation, and Acquisition (?) and Union, and Conjugal Love_: And it will make the Bearer chearful and rich: And it is as excellent as any thing for lascivious and conjugal Love.



Letter III. Γ.

{G}, _the Herb Pæony_. {G} a sort of Owl. {G}, a Stone. {G} a Sea-fish known to all men.

_Glykiside_ is the Herb _Pæon_; and it has a Fruit like the Gum of an Almond Tree. Some of its Seeds are open, and other close. _Glaux_ is a Bird which is ascribed to _Pallos_; it has a Crown of Feathers upon its Head, and great Eyes like a Night-Raven, living in the Fields. _Gnanthius_ is a Stone as hard as a Milstone, like a Granate. _Glaucus_ is a Sea-Fish, known to all men. Now there are two sorts of the Herb, Female and Male. _That a Woman may conceive_: If therefore a Woman do not retain the Man's Seed, and would conceive, let her be girt with the close Seeds of the Divine Herb, trying it in a Linnen Cloth died of seven Colours; let it be put about her Twist. _That she may not conceive_; But if she have no mind to conceive, let her gird her self with the open Seeds, and the Way of a Mules Ear; as long as she pleases.
_For casie (?) Travail_: But if there
be danger in the Pains of Birth, bruise the open Seed, and make it up with Oyl, and (?) and anoint the Loyns and Twist, and she will bear without pain. _To chase away Devils and Phantasms_: And its Root in Fume or in Drink, expels Devils and all (?) Phantasms, and being worm, it does the same. _For a Miracle_. The Eyes of the Bird _Glaux_ and of the Fish _Glaucus_, bruise them with a little Sea-water, and put them in a GLass bottle. But it is better to dissolve the G??? of them both, and to keep it in a Glass bottle. And when you would have the Virtue of Nature to be admired, Parchments must be written with the foresaid soft Collyrium, and in the day indeed it will not appear; but when it is dark, that which is written must be read. And, if you please, draw any _Animal_ upon the wall, and when Night comes they that are in the dark shall think what they see is either Devils or Gods. _That one may seem strong, and glorious, and faithful to men, and that he may see true Dreams_. And if any one will engrave upon the Stone _Gnanthius_ the Bird _Glaux_, and under its Feet the Fish, and under these enclose the Eyes, and wear it, abstaining from Swines Flesh and from uncleanness, when it is dark he shall appear an elegant Man; therefore those that see him, shall think him Divine. In the day time also whatsoever he sayes, he shall be believed in it. And has in bed it will shew true Visions.



Letter IV. Δ.

_Draconthea, the Herb Dragons_. {G}, _the Bird Woodpecker_. _Draco, a Fish_. _Dendritis, a Tree stone_.

_Draconthea_ is an Herb, having Seed like the eyes of a Dragon, bread leaves, is bad altogether. The _Woodpecker_ is a Bird known to all, as big as a Quail, it perforates Oaks, Olive trees and Nut trees, that it may make a Nest in the middle of the Wood. The _Dragon_ is a Sea fish without scales: After therefore that it has voided much, and would also(?) over great violence, the Cloud of Heaven snatch it into the Air, and dash it against the Mountains, tearing it Limb from Limb, so that is it no more. _That one be not hurt_; It is two forked, like a Horses Tail, two fingers in length. Putting it in Oyl, keep it. Putting it in Oyl indeed, it preserves all People from fascination and infirmity. For I saw this upon the Sea coasts of the _Assyrian_ Countrey. _Dendrites_ is a Stone, which is known by many; This grows in
India in Rocky maritime places about six
fingers high. _For Hearing_; The Seed of the
Herb _Draconthea_ worn sharpens the Sight
and removes a little pain in the Head. The
Feather also of the Bird, with a little of the
Stone Dendrites, cures the _Hemicrania_ or half Head-ach. In like manner the
Feather of the Bird, and a little of the Fish
bruised and applied, suddenly cures every
Head-ach. Let us not therefore mistake for
the difficult finding of the great _Draconthea_
but those things which are done, are from
the little Draconthea , which is two hand
breadths high, and it is as the Fish or the
Serpent, and we put this for the other. _For
a {G}, or a Flesh Dropsie, and a
{G}, or Leprosie of the _Arabians_, and
any Leprosie_. For a pain in the Head, and
the beginning of an _Elephantia_ and _Leprosie_
and any breaking out of the Skin, the Fa(?)
of the Dragon-Fish with the Juice of the
Herb, anoynt morning and evening. _To open
Doors, Locks, Dolts, and to tame wild Beasts
and to be beloved of all, and to acquire all(?)
things, that whatever you please may be done
for you_. And if one obtain the hole of
Tree, in which the young ones of the Wood
pecker are, he shall carry the Herb which
knows, and touching it opens; For if it be
made of Clay or Chalk, the dirt will fall:
If of Stone it bursts: If a wooden Board or
iron Plate be so fastned with Nails, all things
cleave and break in pieces upon the touch
of the Herb, and the Woodpecker opens and
takes out her young ones. If any one therefore
have got this Herb, he will do many
things, which are not now lawful to mention,
as of the mod Divine Nature, which Man
cannot perform. If therefore any man engrave
a Woodpecker in the Stone _Dendrites_,
and a Sea-Dragon under its feet, and enclose
the Herb underneath it, which the Woodpecker
found and carried, every Gate will
open to him, and Bolts and Locks. Salvage
Beasts will also obey him, and come to tameness;
he shall also be beloved and observed
of all, and whatsoever he hath a
mind to, he shall acquire and perform. _Mercury_
was a most accursed Pagan, and was
worshipped as a God : but I worship _Christ_,
and do unwillingly write of _Mercury_. _O the
Blessedness of the Gods!_ _Mercury_ is an Animal
unknown to GOD, and also his Nature.
For who can find out the generation of Men?
He is not, yea, a deceiver, Thou art wife,
and instructing hast given understanding in
the Pillar, _Thus far Nature_. But he that
carries it, shall learn those things that are in
the Gods, shall open Locks, and loose Chains,
shall pacifie all wild Beasts by the will which
is in Heaven, shall asswage the waves of the
terrible Sea, shall chase away all Devils,
and shall appear good to all men. But we
will alter for the purpose. If perchance you
should not find the Herb, which opens the
shut Nest of the Woodpecker, enclose under
the engraven Stone the top of a Feather of
the Birds wings and the Heart, and one feed
of the Herb _Draconthea_, and the Stone or
the Brain of the Fish. For being so carried,
they give sharp-sightedness to the Eyes,
cure the Head-ach, and expel all Diseases of
the Eyes and Head from the Bearer. Moreover
they represent him rich and potent to
all Men.



LETTER V. E.

{G}, _the Herb Rocket. Enlui, aëdon,
a Nightingale. {G}, a Sea-Urchin. Enanthus, A Stone._

_Fuzomen_ is the herb Rocket, which is eaten
among pot-herbs, and known to all men.
_Echinus_, the Sea-Urchin is also known to all.
_Enlui_ is a Nightingale, known well enough.
_Enanthus_ is a Stone of every colour, and it
is dedicated to _Venus_, because it is of many
colours. Rocket therefore heats, because
here(?) is an Error among many, and they,
know not the nature of every Herb. Against
Lust and Erection. Therefore Priests eat Rue,
and the herb _Agnus castus_, for Chastity's sake,
For green Rocket quenches Lust much, and
frequent Erection, and Dreams. Wherefore
Priests, when by their turns they serve in the
Temples, do often eat this, and they fall not
into pollution. _For Erection_, of the Seed of
this ℥iv. Pepper ℥i. with Honey morning
and night take as much as you can take up
with two fingers. But if a man be grown old,
and have a loose and hanging Member, he
shall do this. Of Seed of Rocket ℥xvj. Cumin
℥viij, Pepper ℥iv. of Seed of Purslain ℥ij.
Being bruised and made up with Honey, let
him take it morning and evening. It is incomparable.
And the eyes and the heart of a
Nightingale laid about men in Bed, keep them
awake. _To make one die for sleep_. For if any
one dissolve them, and give them secretly to
any in drink, he will never sleep, but will so
die, and it admits not of Cure. _For Epileptick
Persons_. If you give half the Navil of
a Sea-Urchin dissolved, to such as are held
of an Epilepsie, they will presently be relieved;
but give it only with Honey frequently.
_That you may be amiable to men, and
known for eloquence, and acceptable, and that
you may be feared of Men and wild Beasts_.
In the Stone _Enanthus_ with Gold engrave
_Venus_, and let her Locks and the Hair of her
Head be tied to her Head, and put the root
of the Herb, and the Nightingale's Tongue
under her, enclose it and wear it, and you
will be amiable to all men, and known, and
eloquent; and not only to Men, but Devils
and wild Beasts will fly from you.


LETTER VI. Z.
{G}, _the Herb Bindweed. Zaukos, a Bird.
Zmirena, a Sea-fish. Smaragdus, an Emerauld._

_Smilax_ is a very strong Herb, like the Plant
Ivy. _For Women's Travail_. If you Crown a
Woman with it, that has hard Travail, she
will presently bring forth without pain. _For
Prægnation_. If any Woman suffer-difficulty
with pain in prægnation, gird her with it,
and she will breed without pain. And if
you mix of the Juyce of the. Leaves ℥j. and
of Honey another and give it an Hydropick
person, the party will purge without
danger: But a Woman, if she drinks it,
will suffer a Flux of Blood. _Zaucos_ or _Zeucos_,
a sort of Bird, some call it a _Harpe_. For
it is a Vultur devouring white Carkases.
_Zmirena_, a Sea-Lamprey, is known to all.
An Emerauld is a known Stone. Therefore
if you give the Gut of an _Harpe_ to any one
to eat, the Eater will be torn; for he will be
insatiable. And if yon give the great Cut
of it, which is called {G} or _Colon_, powdered
in drink to any or roasted to eat,
it will persectly cure the Colick. _For People
troubled with the Quartane Ague and the Leprosie_:
And its Fat applied with an Oyntment of
Oyl expels a Quartane. The Dung also applied
with Vinegar stops Leprosie. And whatever
you will of the Liver given inwardly,
corrupts all things that are within. _For all
disturbance of Dreams, and Lunaticks, and those
that are troubled with the Colick_. The Emerauld
is a green precious Stone. Engrave ,
therefore upon it the Bird _Harpe_, and under
its feet a Sea-Lamprey, and under the Stone
enclose the Root of the Herb, and wear it,
against Disturbance, and Dreams, and Stupidity.
It causes Rest to Lunaticks, and in
them that are troubled with the Colick. And
it is better, if the Fat of the Sea-Lamprey be
put underneath: For this is Divine.


LETTER VII. H.
{G}, the Herb we call _Fryngo_. {G},
??? _the Sun-Bird, or {G}, i. e having J??let
Wings. {G}, S. emagines, Vulcane's Stone
{G}, the Fish Delight, some call it Assidion, a
kind of Anchovy._

_Eryngo_ is an Herb like _Calamus_; it grows
thorny; its Vertues are such as these: For,
if any carry its Root, he shall not at any
time suffer the Treachery of Devils. _That
the Devil may confess who he is, and from whence?
And to cast him out_: And if any one have
an aëreal Spirit, put one of these Roots under
his Cloaths, and he will confess to you
who he is, and will fly from the Man, a stranger
to him. And the whole Herb drunk
with its Root in Water and Honey asswages
the Colick. _For the Stone-Colick and the Stone,
and the Strangury_: And if it be made hot,
and drunk with Water and Honey, it cures
those those that are troubled with the Stone,
and the Stone-colick, and the Strangury.
And let them drink it for sixteen days, every
Morning, in Bed: But if you heat {G}
(which is Pomgranate-Rind) with it, it will
do more good. _Hedone_ is a Sea-fish, which
is called _Aphydion_, being often eaten, it cures
the bloody Flux, and Pains in the Kidneys.
And in _Hephastion_'s i. e. _Vulcane_'s Stone, which
is called _Pyrites_, or the Fire-stone, if any one
engrave a _Phanicopterus_, and at its Feet a
Scorpion, and put under the Stone the Root
of the Herb, he will have a Phylactery, and
a Guard, or a Treacle against poysonous
Stings; it also drives away nocturnal Phantasms,
and all Witchcraft, and is good also
for those that arc troubled with the Stone.
Being worn, it confers the Grace and Vertue
of Prudence. _Saturnius_ himself wore it, and
_Phaos_ in Heaven; and in Earth it possesses
Gold and Silver; it destroys Infirmity, and
cruel Poverty, and the evil Bonds of Necessity,
that which gives Trouble is not good,
but forces every Earth, beating Men with
the Degree of Fortune, binding them in Necessities.
A certain Saturnine King _Kiranis_
{G}, turning and rolling circular upon
the Centre, with uncorrupt, and never failing
Changes, whirling all things from the
_East_ to the _West_, in the seven Arctick, i. e.
_North_, Stars, holding and moving all strange
things. Soul, be thou content and sufficient
in those things which thou actest in failing
Time! and tho' thou be after Prægnation,
yet presently thou knowest GOD in the
Air, and in the Clouds; thou sufferest Infirmity
upon the Earth, in which being an
Inhabitant, thou art tormented. O blessed
Soul! being thenceforth immortal, cease from
corporeal Labours; tho' in these thou be fixt
to the Body, yet seek Heavenly things, or
from whence Water is? If thou wilt learn, I will
declare to thee all things which thou bidst
me. Heaven is Water and Fire, the Stars
are visible, and unspeakable Darkness is above
the Gods. And a Sphere rolling from
_East_ to _Weft_. And that which moves all things
in the Sphære with wakeful Winds, sets in the
Sea. It brings Lightning, and dissolves the
Air, it strikes with Thunder, and flashes out
flaming Fire; it gives sweet Rain, and gives
all Meat good for the Belly. And the Divine
Virtue, which does this, itself hides all things
that are Earth-born, Roots of Herbs, which
are abroad among divers Generations of Men;
and they are given for all four-footed Beasts,
creeping things, and Fowls of the Air, which
spontaneously do all things in their Nests
and Dens for Man, all well coloured and
green. Let what I said before suffice thee;
I tell thee in Prose, and show unto thee all
the Divinations of the Soul concerning all
Virtues; I will tell thee more, when they are
revealed. For I have told future things in
Metre, or Verse, concerning the fore-knowledge
of other Animals. _For the præscience of
those things that are in Heaven and in Earth,
and what any one has in his Soul; and whatever
things are done in Climates and Cities, and
all future things to Men_. There is an Animal
flying in the Air, which is called {G}, _upupa_,
or Houp, of seven Colours, having a Crest on
his Head, the height of two Fingers, which
extends and contracts. And it is of four Colours,
that it may be directed to the four
Seasons of the Year. This Bird is called Cucubas,
as it is written concerning the same, in
a former Book, that is called _Archaicus_. And
this Animal is sacred. Take therefore this
Bird, and tear it in pieces, and while it is
panting, swallow its Heart, turning to the
Sun, in the beginning of the first, or eighth
Hour, on _Saturday_, the Moon being Oriental,
and drink upon it Milk of a Black Cow,
with a little Honey in the Drink. See that
you swallow the Heart sound and entire,
and you will foreknow what things will be
in Heaven, and what on Earth, and whatever
any one has in his Soul, or whatever
is done in Climates, and in Cities, and what
will come to all Men. And this will be the
Composition of the Honey; Of Honey ℔j,
℥β. living Magnet powdered ℥ij . and tender
Stalks of the Herb Eryngo ℥vij. When these
are bruised, make them up with the Honey,
And you may have another Magnet, wherein
a _Cucubas_, i. e. an Houp is engraven, all which
you must dip in the Composition of the Honey.
And when you would foreknow any
thing, first taste it with the Finger, and put
the engraven Load-stone about your Neck,
and you shall foreknow whatever you please,
And if you put another Liver and Heart of
a _Cucusa_ into the Confection, it will be better,
because it will make you of a stronger
Memory. And that the Heart may not be
corrupted in him that eats it, by six-footed
Creatures, because he that eats this Honey,
and swallows this Heart, uses to breed
many Lice; it is necessary, that he be anointed
first with this Oyl. Take of Oyl ℥vijβ.
of Staves-acre bruised ℥ij. beat them well up
into one, put it up, and keep it in readiness.
And when there is occasion for it, then anoint
your self in Bed. _If therefore thou foreknowest,
foretel to me, whether the Soul be mortal, or
immortal?_ He answering, saith, _Hear, my Son!
Very many false Sophisters are mistaken in the
Understanding of the immortal Soul, but it discerns
it self Why is it, that the Body is at rest
in Bed, and the Soul is conversant in its proper
place, i. e. in the Air, whence also we took
this Soul, and sees what things are done in other
Climates? Many times also there is a sympathy,
as between the Mother and the Child, and
it is solicitous for the Body in which it inhabits,
and before the time foresees and divines future
things, whether they be good or evil, which is
called a Dream. Then it returns to the Body, and its
proper Habitation, and rising it searches out. Hence
it may appear to thee, that the Soul is immortal
and incorporeal._ Thus says _Harpocration_, finishing
this Letter in this place. But _Kiranis_ in
some things sayes other wise; and in other
things agreeing, he sayes concerning the eating
of the _Houp_, that from it there is Præscience
of all worldly things. Then he said
this; Because the Head and Heart and the utmost Root
of Eryngo is hard to be found;
if you will find it without difficulty, you
must do thus: Take the Seed of Eryngo and
the Earth on which it grows, and put the
Earth and Seed into a Potter's or wooden
Vessel, and sprinkle it sometimes with water,
and when the Herb is sprung up, and is come
to maturity, like other Ervngoes, then seek,
it, as it becomes you, fasting and chast, and
you will find the _Gorgon_'s head. Keep this,
and have it in readiness. Take therefore
the Hairs of a _Phoca_, the Seal, which are between
his Nose and his Mouth, and the
green Jasper Stone, and the Heart and Liver
of the Houp, and the Roots of the _Gorgon_
of Eryngo, and the feed of {G}
i. e. upright Vervein, and the clean Blood of
_Chrysanthemum_, i. e. the Juice of the Herb _Plumaria_
or _Strechas_, and the extremity of the
heart of the Seal, and moreover the Crest of
a Houp's head also; it were better if you
had of all the foresaid sorts. Which you
must wrap up with a little Moss with _Thymiana_
of four sorts, and put it in the skin of
an _Ichneumon_, or Seal, or Stag, or Crow, or
Vultur, and wear it chastly. And if you guild
the outside, it will be better, for you will acquire
whatever you have a mind to, you will
be beloved of Men and Women, and you
will appear reverend, and peaceful, and quiet:
you will tame wild Beasts, and conquer
your Enemies. And if you put the right
eye of a Wolf into the foresaid things, you
will overcome all wild Beasts, and you will
acquire by all things. Devils and wild Beasts
will fly you, and you will be most happy,
and healthful, and altogether unhurt. For I
mixt also the Rennet of a Sea-Calf, I overcame
all my Enemies, and I was invincible.
For he that carries this Phylactery, shall have
Gifts from GOD, which he hoped not for,
and he shall be honoured on every hand, conquering
all men in Word and Work, deliveing
from all danger, and from the Devil, and
from Witchcraft, and from all Evil. I will
say further: _It averts all evil, and confers all
good_. This also is a Prognostick, which only
GOD and you must know. _This Letter of_
Kirani _is perfect_.



LETTER VIII. Θ.

{G}, _Herba Dionysi, Ivy. Thyr, a Bird. Thyrsites a Stone. {G} a Fish_.

_Thyrsites_ or _Thyrsus_ the Herb of _Bacchus_, fruitful and profitable for all things. _Thyr_ is a Bird like the Hawk of the Sea, having a divine Efficacy. _Thyrsite_ is a Stone like to Coral. _Thynnus_, a Tuny, is a Sea-fish, and
is eaten, like to a Whiting, which being
great is known indeed. _Balkera_ is _Bacchus_
his Plant. In the Feasts of _Bacchus_ they put
the _Thyrsus_ upon the Wine-presses, the plant of
the earth is given to Men for chearfulness, the
Virtues whereof I now will tell. It is good
in Wine to pour out in the Presses, what
Mortals forever have it given them: I will also
say this in Verse, To see or know is of the
Earth. _For Joy and Mirth in Drink_. If
you bruise ℥ij of this Plant, and of the
Stone, and shall say over it the Name of
Bacchus, shall put it into a Flagon of Wine,
out of which they all drink Wine, having
drunk but one Glass they will all be mellow,
as if they were drunk, and returning thanks
they will say; Thou haft mad e us merry, O
Lord! _Here Friends may drink, and go away
merry and rejoycing_; If you put the right
eye of a _Thynnus_ (or Tuny) or of an _Athynnus_
in Wine, the Friends that are sate
down will break into Joy without drinking, and they will thank you, as if they were merry. _For Discord at Feast_; And if you cut the Wing or the top of a Feather of the Bird _Thyr_ with a Sword that is all Iron, and put it into a Vessel of Wine, saying over it the Name of _Bacchus_, and when you have a mind, make them that are sate down spill it that they may shed blood and beat one another, and it will be so.
_That you may be without Drunkenness, and for all favour and
health_; In the Stone _Thyrsites_ engrave the
Bird _Thyr_ and _Bacchus_ holding the Bird, and
under the Stone enclose the Root of the Herb,
and wear it, and you will be without Drunkenness,
and will have Favour with all men,
and moreover you will be without danger
and invincible in the Palace. For this is a
divine Dionysiack, and weakens the strength
of _Bacchus_. For so sayes _Harpocration_.



LETTER IX. I.

{G}, i.e. a Willow, a fruitless Tree, j]{G},
A Jasper Stone, green. {G}, a Kite, a Bird.
{G}, a Fish.

The Willow is a barren Tree. The Jasper
is a known Stone. The Kite is a Bird known
to all men. The {G} is a party-coloured
Sea-fish, which is easily found. Bruise, I say,
the green Leaves of Willow with a little Salt,
and apply it to the aking Spleen, and the
pain will presently cease. And if you would
have the Spleen dissolved, boyl the Bark with
_Oxymel_, and give two spoonfuls tasting, or
thus: Make it to boyl to a third, and give
to every one according to his own strength.
And in a Jasper engrave a Kite tearing a Serpent,
and under the Stone put a Stone taken
out of the head of a Kite, and enclose it, give
it to wear in the Breast, for it will drive away
all pain of the Stomach, and will create
an Appetite to eat, and good Digestion. For
it has also other Virtues, let it be worn only
in the Breast.



LETTER X. K.

{G}, {G}, _an Herb, a Stone, a
Bird, and a Fish so called._

_Kynædius_ is an Herb, which is also {G}
_Meretricis_, Whores Vervein; _centum capita_
{G}, the hundred heads of _Venus_. _Kynædius_
is a Bird, which is called _Iynx_, as
_Kiranus_ says in the Verse of Theocritus; for
Example's sake:

{G}.
Per te, Iynx, meus ille domum vir quæso
trahatur!
_Pray_ Iynx! _Fetch my Husband home again!_

Some call it _Jugius Ales_. _Kynædius_ is a Fowl,
and feeds like a Quail turning back its neck,
as _Harpocration_ sayes. This has three Stones
about its neck, it has a long tongue, and is
often dedicated to _Venus_. _Kynædius_ a Sea-fish,
is about fix fingers in greatness, it has a
broad head like an _Uletinus_. It is a round
Fish, of a translucid Body, so that its Backbone
appears through its Body, as through
a Glass; and it abounds in the Sea of _Syria_
and _Palestine_, and of _Syria_ of _Lybia_. This
therefore has two Stones, which also have
their proper actions, as we shall mention
hereafter. And they are in the head. And it
has also another Stone in the third Joynt of
the back towards the Tail, which is most
powerful, and is requisite in the Spell or Ligature
of {G}, i. e. _Venus_. The Stone
_Kynædius_ was unknown, because it is exceeding
scarce, and is called _Opisranus_ ({G})
i. e. late or slow. For it is Saturnine. This
Stone is double or twofold: One is obscure
and black; the other is black indeed, but
bright and shining like Glass. This is that
which many seek, and do not know it: for
it is the Dragon's stone. If therefore with a
little of the Herb and Vulture's dung you
make a Fume under a Peach-Tree, the Leaves
will fall. _That a man's Member cannot be
erect, till what is laid be removed_. And if one
lay the Herb under the Pillow, he that lies
upon it shall not erect, and if you give a little
of the Herb powdered in drink to a
Man, he will not erect to coition for seven
dayes. _That a Cock may not tread an Hen_;
Give it to a Cock in Bran or Paste, and he
will not tread a Hen. _That a man for one
day may be {G},i_ i. e. _a Fornicator_; That
which is in the Fish _Kynædius_, in the third
Joynt of the backbone, if you give it in
meat or drink, a man will be a manifest Fornicator
for one day. _To make a Cock tread a
Cock_; If you give it to a Cock with Paste,
he will get upon other Cocks, and upon any
Male Animal. If therefore any thing take
this Stone, it will get upon the like animal,
as upon a Female. And the aforesaid stone
does all these things. _To obtain favour and
friendship_; If anyone carry the Tongue of
the Bird in a Plate of Gold, he shall have
Favour, and be beloved of all. _To make
Men soft_; if the ends of the wings, of the
Flesh (I mean) not of the Feathers, be
secretly given to a Man, or to any Male Animal,
he will become soft, and do female
works. _For Favour_; And if any one carry
the right eye under an immaculate Saphire
stone, whereon _Venus_ is engraven, he
will be gracious and acceptable to all, and
will overcome in every Consistory. And the
left eye carried by a Woman, will do the
same. _To make the Eyes bloodshot_; The Blood put
in a plate for a _Collyrium_, and found, makes the
eyes bloodshot. _For a Tertian and a Quartan
Ague_; And the Heart tied about one, when
the Moon is in the Wane, cures People of
Tertian and Quartan Agues. _For an incurable
Head-ach_; And the Brain of the Bird given
secretly in Drink or Meat, eases an incurable
Head-ach. _For Hepatick Persons_; And
its Liver boyled with Salt and Water cures
Hepatick Persons. _Of Goddess_ Venus _her Girdle_;
The kind of _Venus_. The first and strong
_Cestus_, i. e. Girdle, mollifies the hearts
of Men, and of all Animals, and the Natures
of the Males especially, so that the touching
or carrying of this makes them soft and effeminate.
Further also; Upon the Stone _Opfarius_
engrave a Man having his Privities cut
off, placed or lying at his Feet, and his hands
contracted underneath; and himself reaching
down to his Privities, and behind his back
let there be Venus, having back to back, she
turning her self, and seeing him. Enclose
therefore the Stone of the Fish _Cynædius_. But
if you have not one of them which are under
the head, you must put underneath the
Root of the Herb, and the end of the Bird's
left wing. Enclose it in a large Gold Box,
and you must put it into a thong of the nerve
of a Hawk's Stomach, let it be thin, sewing
it in the middle of the thong or nerve, that
it do not appear. This is that which is painted
in the head of _Venus_, comprehended in
a thong or ligature, which is called _Cestus_.
_That a male may not erect_; If any one touch
a Male with the thong or ligature, he will
not erect, and if he carries it unknowingly,
he grows effeminate. And if he carry any of
the Stone of the Fish, he will be altogether
luxurious, not returning to his Nature. And
if a Woman carry this ligature, none will carnally
lie with her. For the Man cannot erect.
And the measure of the ligature in respect of
breadth, must be two fingers; of length, five
palms. _Another Preparation of Venus_; There
is also another Vessel or Preparation of _Venus_,
which the Queens of Venus carry in pure
Gold, and whoever else are able. These also
must be in a ligature, which is made of a
nerve in such a manner, as that the stones
appear not, having a Sculpture, as is subjoyned.
And the first must be (_Lapis Sulphureus_)
_Lechnitis_ or _Kerannitis_ in the middle of the
thong or ligature, having _Mars_ armed engraven.
In this let there be Diamond stones
sewed, having _Venus_ with a thorn about her
feet. And again on the other side two immaculate
winged Creatures, having _Venus_ tied
by her hair to Love standing by. Again also
other two stones on each side, and in like
manner a _Sardinian_ engraven, having on each
side a Sun drawn with four Colts, that is, a
Coach, and a Moon with two Bulls, each stone
having each: And other two stones on each
side, having _Mercury_ engraven, with the rod
of a Scepter in his right hand: And other
two _Anankite_, i. e. true Unions or white Pearl,
having on each side Erachmites, i. e. reins, the
Goddess _Nemesis_ having her foot upon a
wheel, and holding a Rod. And other two
immaculate Pearls, being on each side not
engraven, and put in the _Cesius_; so that in all
there are thirteen Stones nxt in Golden Cases,
and so sewed in a ligature, that they may
not be seen by the Crowd. And there is a
twofold holy ligature, and it follows: Another
Stone may be carried, hung about the
neck, which is called {G} i. e. Lunar
Stone, in which the Encrease of the Moon
and its Divinity appears. And let it have a
Moon engraven, and underneath the Stone
the Root of barren _Selinum_, that is,
Parsly, in a Gold Case. And this is worn
about the neck. _For wonderful and magnificent
Acts_; This Mystery worn makes the wearer
divine, and he is in veneration and adored
by all. For many Kings carry it under-hand,
or within their Crown, as a _Cestus_, so that
it may be seen of none. And they say, that
a _Selenites_ worn in a Ring does the same. But
that we may not destroy our Boo , let this
Discourse suffice, for it has great Virtues.
Wherefore, my Son! I have expounded and
written these things with great study and labour.
And know this, that no one else has
it. Wherefore give this Divine Mystery to no man.


LETTER XI. Λ.

{G}, _the Frankincense tree. Lyngurius, a Stone. Lynx, a Vulture. {G} a Fish called Bass.

Libanus is a shrubby tree, whole Gum
fumigated raises divine Spirits. _Lingurius_ is a
stone about the Hills _Lingui_, thence so
called. But some say it is the Gum of the
Poplar tree; however it is good. _Lynx_ is a
Bird, which is called Gyps or a Vulture, a
very strong Creature. _Labrax_ is a Sea-fish
called a _Bass_, known to all. _Of these (???)
Eye-Salve is made for all dimness of the Eyes
so that in three days it makes the Sight sharp. It
is good for the beginning of a Suffusion, a Cataract,
turning back of the Eye-lid, Roughness
dilatation of the Pupilla, Owl-fightednes, Watriness,
itchng, Driness, falling away of the
hairs of the Eye-lids, eating away of the Corners
of the Eyes, and for many other Diseases. Anointing
with it is excellent good for all these things._ And
this is the Confection of it: Of _Olibannum_ ℥iv.
_Lapis Lyngurius_ ℥ii. Vultures Gall ℥vi. liver
of a Bass ℥iij. the best Honey ℥vj. When
this is old, it is better. But _Kirani's_ Eye Salve
was thus;  Of _Olibanum_ ℥vj. Gall of a
_Bass_, Gall of a Vultur, each ℥vj. Prpper ℥iij.
Honey without dross ℥iij. In the _[Lapis?]
Lyngurius_ engrave a Vulture, and put underneath
a little Frankincense, and the top of
the Bird's Wings, and carry it: for it will be
good for the Pin and Web in the Eyes.



LETTER XII. M.

{G}, _a Mulberry tree. Migrios, a Bird,
Mydicus, a Stone. Mormyros, a Fish known
to all._

The _Mulberry tree_ is known to all. _Migrios_
the Bird, is a Night-Raven, known to all.
_Mydicus_, the Stone, is dedicated to _Venus_. _Mormyros_
is a little edible Sea-fish, like a Bass.
_To make a Diarrhea and Evacuation_; The
Juice of the Root of the Mulberry-tree given
secretly in meat or drink, purges, and
causes a _Diarrhea_. And if any one chew
the inner Rind of the Root, and swallow his
Spittle, and spit out the Substance, that man
will die of a _Diarrhea_. _It is good for great
pain in the Teeth called Grinders, and in the
Gums, and does not suffer them to corrode, yea,
it makes them that are corroded, fill without
pain_. Of the inner Rind ℥ij. of sharp Vinegar
℥xix. Bruise or shred the Rind, boyl it
half away; wash the Mouth with it morning
and evening. _For Womens Flux of Blood from
the Matrix or from the Arse_; And we have
discoursed this by the divine power. Some
therefore of the boughs of the Mulberry tree
are upright, others look down to the ground,
and they have large Buds like an Egg. If any
man then shall stand upright on his feet,
and shall look towards the South-west wind,
and with two fingers of his left hand shall
raise the bud of the twig of a Branch that
looks upward, extending and pulling it towards
the East. and shall wrap it up in true
Purple or Red, and tie it about, and shall
touch a Woman that is troubled with a flux
of Blood from the Matrix or Arse, the Flux
will stop in three days. _For such as spit
Blood_; But if a man pluck a Bud that looks
downward, as before was said, _i. e._ standing,
and shall tie it up, he will stop spitting of
Blood in three dayes. These are the things
they call Anacardia; those indeed that look
upwards cure inferior Fluxes in so many
dayes, and those that look downward, cure
the superior. And this is that for the Flux
of Blood, which they call {G}, or {}.
_For the Enteridæ, which are called
Exophanæ, or {G}, i. e._ the Hæmorrhoids.
Indeed many false Sophisters are mistaken.
But for the _Enteridæ_, which are called _Hæmorrhoides_ and Exochades, a Medicine is made.
It is of the unripe Juice of the Mulberry ℥ij.
_Chalcitis_ ℥xij. _Lapis Indicus_ ℥iv. The ends of
seven Crows wings with a little Wine, mix it
with a Feather of the fame wings, till it is
soft and tough like Glew. For the inner
_Hæmorrhoids_ make Suppositories or Clysters,
and for the _Exochades_ or outer , make inunctions.
And in the Name of GOD use this
Ligature. In a little Stone engrave the Fish
_Mormyrus_, and enclose it in an Iron Box, and put under it a Bud of Mulberry-tree looking upward, and carry it. _It will be good for Hæmorrhoids and in the Arse. For spitting of Blood, and Bleeding at the Nose, and and Diseases above_; A Purge also is prepared of the Root of the Mulberry-tree. O Mulberry-tree! a potent plant, not created for a few things! For thy Juice mixt equally with the Juice of the root of the Herb _Stratiotes_ of _Persia_, _i. e._ Savory, and in like manner the Juice of Tithymal and Scammony equally, mix them all equally, and boyl thrice as much Honey to the thickness of an Oyntment, and when you have taken it off, put it up in a Glass Bottle, and give of it one fasting and that keeps an exact Diet. But if you give above the bigness of a Bean, he that takes it will be seized with a Vomiting and Looseness, and will not live a day. Give nothing superfluous in Meat or Drink, but give to every one according to the strength of the Taker. 



LETTER XIII. N.

{G}, _an Herb. Nancrates, a Fish. {G},
Bird. Nemesites, a Stone._

{G}, is the herb _Florinus_, i. e. _Tapsus
Mormjrits, and enclose it in an Iron Box, and Barbatus_ or _Mullein_: There are seven sorts of this Herb. It differs therefore as much as the Leaves, which ascend a cubit above the Earth, They burn the Leaves of this in Lamps for Wieks, For they have them in {G} (_i. e._ in Necromancy) which is performed in a Shell., which they do to this day. Wherefore they call this herb _Nekya_. _For {G}_ signifies _dead_. {G}, i. e. a Duck, is a bird swimming in Rivers, about the bigness of a Hen. {G} is the Sea-fish {G}, or _Remora, i. e._ Stop-ship; if this stick a Ship under Sail, it will not suffer the Ship stir, it would break first, or a Tree might sooner be pluckt up by the roots. _For the Gout_; This whole Fish boyled in Oyl, to the thickness of Wax, then the Oyl strained out, and boiled to the thickness of a Plaster, this applies Plasterwise cures the Gout. _Nemesites_ is a Stone from the Altar of _Nemesit_, a Goddess of the _Athenians_, It is an excellent stone. Let _Nemesit_ therefore be engraven on that stone, having one of her Feet upon a Wheel. Her Favour is like a Virgin's, holding in her left hand a _Pirrhis_, _i. e._ an Elne or Measure, and in her right hand a Rod, and with one foot treading upon an Oxe. And enclose under it the stone _Acronius_, and a little of the Mulberry-tree. _If therefore you shew that Finger to one possessed, the
Devil will immediately confess himself and be
gone._ _It is good also for Phantasms, and Dreams
of Devils, and for Childrens Frights, and
Nightly Fears._ But the Wearer must abstain
from all polluted and unclean things. _For this
Ring king worn, shews the quantity of the years of
life, and the quality of death, and the place._ If you
sew a little of the bones of the short Fish
_Remora_ in a Horses Hide, and have it with
you when you take shipping, _the Ship will
not budge in the water at hoisting Sail,_ unless
what is put there be taken away, or you go
out of the Ship. _For the, fore-knowledge of
Life and Death-; as I said before, you must
use the prægustation, or præcognition of the
Hawk.



LETTER XIV. Ξ.

{G}, _an Herb. Xiphius, a Stone. Xiphius,
a Bird. {G}, a Fish known to all,
 called_
Spatha _or_ Gladius.

_Xiphion_, i.e. _Gladiole_, is an herb, which
abounds in all Lands; it has Leaves like
Corn, but longer. It grows in plowed
grounds with Corn, some call it _Machera_,
_i.e._ a Knife or Skien, others {G}, a
Sword. It ascends upright from the ground
as one Arm; and it is but of one Branch. It
Has a Gold coloured, purplish, sweet-sented
Flower. Shepherds make Garlands of it in
the Spring time. _Xiphias_ a kind of Sapphire,
a stone known to all, this is as plentiful as
Pebbles in every Land, it is of colour like
to _Calenos_. in the Region of Syria they use this
at the burnt Sacrifice of four-footed Beasts.
_Xiphius_, the Bird, is a kind of Hawk, which
is called _Kydos_. _Xiphias_ the Fish is party-coloured,
little and small like the _Iülis_. The
Flower therefore and Root of the Herb if a
quantity be kept in a Jar or Hogshead of Oyl,
and continue there for some time, when you
take it out and put it up again, it will be
the Unguent, that is required in the Sacred
Books, which in the Country of _Melanitis_ is
called _Sustnum_. About which the old Prophets
are mistaken. But in the Country of
_Syria_ the Plant is called _Susannum_, and in
_Melanitis Susinum_. This Herb has two roots,
one above and another below. _If therefore
you give the upper Root to any one mixt in Wine,
to drink, he will erect: But es any one drink.the
tower, it will do the contrary, and he will be
without seed. In the Stone therefore engrave
a Hawk , and under its feet a Fish, and enclose
the Root of the Herb under the Stone,
and keep it. This Ring is chast, and so is
he that wears it. If therefore you have it
about you, in the Oracle you will see, what
you have a mind to. And if you put it upon
any Animal, or upon any framed Idol, it
will give you an Oracle concerning all that,
which you have a mind to know. And the
Head of the Fish put into a suffumigation
with Myrrh, makes them that smell it seem
as if they were possessed with the Devil. But
do you anoynt your Nose with strong Oyntment,
and you will no way be enraged or
mad.



LETTER XV. O.

_{G}, an Herb. {G}, a Bird. Orphos
a Fish. {G}, a Stone known to all._

_Onothyris_ or _Onothyrsis_ is an Herb, some
call it {G} _i. e._ Asses Mallow, this is a
Rose, of which they make Garlands; It has
Leaves like domestick Mallow. This by the
Greeks is called {G} i. e. _Malvaviscus_
Marsh-Mallow. _Ortyx_, a Quail, is a Bird known to all,
yet its Nature is not easily known; for there
is one thing concerning this, unknown. _For
when there are great Storms upon the Coasts of_
Lybia deserta, _the Sea casts up great Tunnies
upon the shore, and these breed Worms for fourteen
dayes, and grow to be as big as Flies, then
at Locusts , which being augmented in bigness
become Birds, called Quails. After this the
South or South-west Wind blowing strong, they
pass the Seas into_ Pamphylia _or_ Cilicia _and_ Ireland,
_and consquently, the North-wind blowing,
they go to the Sea-coasts of the Country of_ Syria
_and the other parts of the Land of_ Melanitis.
_But abominable false Sophisters say, they are
chast, whereas they know not the Nature
of them._ _Orphos_ is an edible Sea-fish, much
like a Tench. _Onychites_ is a _Sardonix_ stone
known to all. The Root therefore of the
Herb boyled with Oyl and the Fat of a Quail,
and then a little Wax added, _is good for baraness
of the Matrix, and Swellings, and Ulcers,
and Itchings, and all other Womens Diseases in
the_ Matrix. And it is put into Medicines for
the Kidneys. And it is good for _Cheironia,
i. e._ the King's Evil. The Eyes of a Quail,
with the Root of the Herb hung about one
diminish a Quotidian and Quartan cold Fire
in the wain of the Moon. _For Illusion;_ Dissolve
the Eyes of the Quail or of the Sea
Tench with a little water in a Glass-Vessel
for seven dayes, then add a little Oyl: Put
a little of this in the Candle, or only anoint a
Rag, and light it among the Company, and
they will look upon themselves like Devils or
fire, so that every one will run his way.
In the _Sardonyx_ Stone engrave a Quail, and under
its Feet a Sea-Tenon, and put a little of the
foresaid Confection under the Stone in the
hollow of the Ring. And when you are willing
not to be seen, anoint your Face all over
with the foresaid Confection, and wear the
Ring, and no Man shall see you, if you do
any thing in the House; no, not if you should
take any thing away that is in the House.
