A.

{G} i. e. _a She-Goat, known to all,_ which
is also called the Oracle. For if a man
put a She-Goat's skin about one, _troubled
with the Falling Sickness,_ and lead him along
a River or the Sea-side, by and by he will
be taken falling and trembling, and in an
agony. _For People in bloody Fluxes;_ And
the Blood of a She-Goat heated over the
Fire and eaten, cures Dysenterick persons
_and effectually saves them, that have drank
poysonous potions, and perfectly cures people of the
Dropsie._ And the Gall applied with Honey
without dross _cures Dimness, Spech, and the
Pin and Web in the Eyes._ The Spleen also of a
She-goat roasted and eaten, cures the _bloody
Flux._ And its dry Dung drunk with wine
and honey _helps difficulty in Urine._ And its
Dung mixt with Pultesses, and spread upon
the Sores, _heals them that are stung with a Spider,
or Serpent, or a Prester._ And boiled in
old wine and applied, _it perfectly cures swellings
of the Limbs, and Genitals, and Breasts._
And mixt with Honey and melted and applied,
it _cures them, and draws out all Venom._
And the Spleen of a She-Goat taken fresh
and hot in the Name of the Patient, and
laid upon the Spleen _of one troubled with the
Spleen,_ and swathed on only one day, afterwards
taken off, then let the sick party hang
it in the Smoak, or Sun, or Wind; as much
as the Spleen of the She-Goat dries away,
so much will the Patient's Spleen waste. And
the Spleen of a Kid drunk _heals them that are
bitten by Serpents;_ And the Rennet of it
drank, or eaten roasted, _cures the Bloudy
Flux_: And boyled with Galls and Olives
and eaten, _it stops the Flux of the Belly._ And
the Spleen of this Creature roasted and eaten,
_cures People of the Spleen._ Its Skin, burnt in
a Fume, _raises Lethargick people, and them
that fall in an Epilepsie, and them that have
Fits of the Mother._ And its Hair suffumigated
_does the same_.
