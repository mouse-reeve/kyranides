# kyranides

This is the text of an anonymous 1685 English translation of Kyranides, an ancient (4th century) Greek text on the uses of herbs, stones, animals, and talismans. 

`transcription.md` is my process document, and `kyranides.md` is a reformatted and cleaned up version (both very incomplete).
