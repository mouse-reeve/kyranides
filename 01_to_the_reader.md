A Fter diligent Search for this Book, LA having by happy accident met with
- it , and procured it for my uſe 3
ſince I am minded to communicate it to the Curious and Worthy, I ſhall give you ſome account of the Authors, and their Work. The Authors are Kiramus and Hur pºcration. Kiramus was King of Perſia, to which Crown none but Magicians could be admitted, and of which Kingdom the famous Zoroaſtres the firſt Magician, was. This work of his had been for many Ages turned out of the Perſian into the Syriack, Arabick, and moſt Eaſtern Tongues. Harpocration, as the Learned are of opinion, was a Gracian. There were ſeveral of this Name. One of
them wrote a Lexicon upon the Ten Greek Orators, jacobus Mauffacus publiſhed him With Notes and a critical Diſcourſe upon

him ; where he mentions ſeveral Harpocrati ons, and among the reſt ours, as the Sequel will prove. Heis at a mighty loſs about one Har
pocration, whom Tertullian mentions in his Book De Coroma Milità. Tertullian's Words
are theſe; Liberum, eundem apud AEgyptios Oſirin, Harpocration induſtriá hederatum argu: mentatur, quod hedera matura ſit cerebrum ab heluco defenſare. In Engliſh thus 3 Harpocra tion does argue , that Bacchus , the ſame with Oſiris among the AEgyptians, is piùured with Ivy on purpoſe, becauſe it is the mature of Ivy to defend the Brain from Drunkemmeſ. Now Mauſſacus, after he had confuted the Miſtakes of ſeveral Commentators upon theſe words of Tertulliam, who would make him to mean Harpocration that wrote the Lexicon, comes to one Commentator, whom he thinks in the right. Theſe are the Words of Mauſſacus. “jacobus Pamelius, the laſt Commentator up “on Tertulliam, has taken another, and a quite “new courſe : For he thinks that Harpocra “tion, whom Tertulliam mentions, is the ſame “with him, whoſe Manuſcript Book tº qu “cºy J wºueow is kept in the Vatican. And “if we relie on his Credit, Tertulliam's words

Learned Critick of his time, giving an ac count of ſome Greek Phyſicians, who were never yet publiſhed, ſtrangely extolls Kirani. For whereas others only tranſcribed one from another, and little is to be hadfrom any one of them, that may not be found in Hip
pocrates and Galen ; Kirani has many prodi

of his Age. Barthius would by all means have had it publiſhed, being a Book of ſuch infinite value : And the rather becauſe it has ſome
thing of Harpocration in it, who is ſo highly and deſervedly valued by Learned Men. And he reckons it to be Tertullian's Harpocration, as Pamelius before him imagined, and as by comparing the Paſſages in theſe two Authors we have already proved. So that it is not. only my Opinion, but it is the Conjećture of Pamelius, who could not after his moſt inquiſitive
Search and Reſearch, meet with Harpocration 5 and it is the clear Judgment of that vaſtly Learned Man Barthia, who ſaw Harpocration. And I the rather mention Bar thius, becauſe this Tranſlation is from a Co
py of that very Manuſcript which he ſaw in Dr. Ellenberger's hand. Being thus far ſatis fied of the Original Authors, our next buſi neſs will be to enquire concerning the Tran ſlators of them. Barthius conječtures that the
Tranſlation out of the Agarene, or Arabick Language into the Greek, was the Work of a Monk of Conſtantinople, in the time of Ma nuel or Emanuel Comnenus, the Son of Calojo annes ; the Concluſion of whoſe Life and
Empire was foretold them both in two Greek , Oracles. The Father's in this 5 'o. 73; ºvºian 39&ng jerºv geºzzy! i. e. Oh, how ſhalt thou become the Food of unlucky Crows And this

Now (ºx) the laſt Syllable (and the two laſt Letters) of Mºrºx, that Emperor's Name, ſignifies Eight and Thirty: And he reigned ſo many years. Beſides, Hiſtorians write, how at that time the Greek Nation was mightily yaddićted to Magick. And ſo, in all likeli hood , this Greek Interpreter muſt be well skilled therein. The next Tranſlation out of
Greek into Latine, was made about three or
four hundred years ſince, by one Gerarduº, a
moſt excellent Phyſittan of that time. Tri themius ſirnames him Fulgima, 5 Raphael Pola terramus, Suchomas; but Geſner and the moſt call him Cremomenſit. This Latin Tranſlation has been quoted by many at the ſecond hand. But I never met with any that ſaw ſo much as a Manuſcript of it, till Barthius (as we told you) ſaw it in Dr. Ellenberger's Hand, who kept it as a pre cious Jewel, and a great Rarity. He had wrote in the Book with his own Hand, That he re ceived this Book in Manuſcript, as a ſingular Boom, from the mºſt Illuſirious Lady, the Lady E LEO NOR,Landgraveſ of Heſſe,deſcended from the Family of the Dukes of Wirtemberg, at Darmſtad, Anno M.

ter Dr. Ellenberger's Death, this Treaſure fell to his Son Chriſtian William Ellenberger, who being a Soldier, beſtowed it upon a Phyſician, his Acquaintance and Friend. This Phyſici an printed it privately 3 for neither his own, nor the Printer's, nor the place's Name is printed. But he ſays, he was forced to leave the Univerſity, and to retire into the Coun- trey, by reaſon of the Plague, of which the Famous Sennertus died, and he only took this curious Manuſcript with him, and in his Re
tirement fitted it for the Preſs. It bears

I find alſo, that great De ference was given to our Authors: Inſomuch that Albertus Magnus (who is quite ſpoiled by unskilful Tranſcribers) quotes this very Book. For in Trimum Magicum, p. 168, there is this Paſſage, Magicalis cognitio exiſtit in ſpeculatione rationum, cº in ſpeculatione matura lium, ſecundum quod antiquis Authoribus exami navi & percepi, imo & egomet Albertus, ut in pluribus veritatem inveni, & veritatem ſuppomo (eo modo) quo ab aliquo ex CHYRANDIS li bro, & libro ALCHORAT (ſc eruere licuit) Where it is plain enough, that it was firſt written CYRANIDIS libro & ARPOCRATI.

ONIS, and by miſtake ſo miſèrably depraved. But ſince Albertus, many learned Men of the Moderns have made uſe of Kirami, as Geſner, Aldrovandu, Balduinus Ronſeus, and others. As for Medicines, I know no Specifick men
tioned by the Ancients, and very few by the Moderns, which he has not, beſides many, that are to be met with no where elſe. But
becauſe for ſome Ages paſt, to have been a
Magician, or a Wiſe Man, was Capital, it will be neceſſary to remove ſome Prejudices re ceived againſt Magick or Wiſdom, which I
think cannot better be done, than by ſhewing what true Magick or Wiſdom is, and how far is is conſiſtent with the Holy Scriptures, which ſeem moſt to condemn it. Now, Magick i
take to be a skill which by a certain Power, yet not ſupernatural, but created, is able to do unu fual things, whoſe Cauſes are beyond the common Comprehenſion of Men. In this Definition we exclude Miracles, as ſupernaturally wrought by the Finger of GOD. And by excluding from it all Diabolical Contraćt, we muſt in
tend no other than Magick purely natural, or the Skill of managing Nature by Art, ſo as to accompliſh ſtrange things. We know it was the Ambition of Knowledge that ruined our Firſt Parents; but they had to do in that Affair with the Devil. And I make no doubt, but they had the Knowledge of Good, before

they taſted of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, the latter part whereof has al moſt obliterated the former in their poſterity, though the former is that which we aim at, and which Adam undoubtedly had in his In
nocency. For all the Learned hold him to have had an exact Knowledge of the Vertues of things before the Fall. And this Know ledge was delivered from Father to Son before the Flood, till Seth engraved it on Pil
lars, and ſo by thoſe Monuments, as well as by Noah's oral Tradition, the Poſt-Diluvi ans were inſtructed in the ſame. Abraham,
is ſaid to have had skill in Aſtrology. And the Scriptures teſtifie,what skill in the Magick of Imagination his Grand-ſon 3. had, from
his pilled Rods, that he ſet before the Flocks, when they conceived. Moſes is not only ac counted a Magician by Heathen Writers, but the Scriptures teſtifie, how he was learned in all the Wiſdom of the AEgyptians, whereof Magick was no ſmall Share, as their Magici ans working Wonder for Wonder with Mo
ſes, a little while, prove. -
We read alſo of wiſe Charming in the Pſalms, of which ſort of Charming we have a Form in this Book, pag. 152. And if we ſhould narrow ly enquire into all the Books of Scripture, we might perceive, that the Authors of them were skilled in the power of Nature, as well

as of Godlineſs, the former whereof, was, and
is called Magick. Nay, the Magi of the Eaſt, were more devout in following their Star, to worſhip our Saviour, than all the Nation of the Jews. So that Magick (unleſs with jam me, and jambres, we uſe it in oppoſition againſt GOD)is not only lawful, but commendable. But whereas Kirani undertakes to caſt out,
and drive away evil Spirits by natural Means,
this is but what Tobias in the Apocrypha did by the perſuaſion of the Angel: For he remembred the words of Raphael, and took coals for per fumes, and put the Heart and Liver of the Fiſh thereupon, and made a perfume. The which ſmell when the evil Spirit had ſmelled, he fled into the atmoſt parts of Ægypt, whom the Angel bound. The Angel likewiſe told Tobias, that as for the Gall, amoynt a Man that has Whiteneſ; in his Eyes, and he ſhall be healed. And he took hold of his Father, and ſprinkled of the Gall in his Fathers Eyes, ſaying, be of good hope my Father. And when his Eyes began to prick, he rubbed them; And the Whiteneſ, pilled away from the corners of his Eyes, and then he ſaw his Son. Now Ki rani ſo far explains the Apocrypha, as to tell us the Heart, the Liver and the Gall of what:
Fiſh it is, that does theſe things. -
I remember, I have heard of a Phyſician2
erminent for the cure of Lunaticks, who is ſaid to have uſed ſuffumigations or perfumes of
ſome
ſomething in his Cures. And ſuch you may meet with here.
You muſt take notice, that in the firſt Book, in the concatenation of the Vertues of
things according to the four Elements, the Plants are analogous to Earth, Fiſhes to Wa
ter, Birds to Air, and Stones to Fire. For
Nature's Interpreters do aſcribe miraculous
Virtues to Gemmus; and without doubt thoſe
efficacious and abſtruſeproperties deſcend from a peculiar influence of the Stars, and a better
temperament of the Elements. And is it a
great Argument it is ſo, becauſe in the Eaſtern Countries, where the Sun is hotteſt, the beſt Stones are found. And therefore Kirani a
ſcribes fiery Virtues to Stones, and makes one to be under one Planet, and another under
another. But it were endleſs to give an ac count of all the Raritics herein contained.
Therefore with Piety and Wiſdom peruſe theſe four Books themſelves. The Worth and
Rarity whereof, I am afraid, has tempted ſome diſhoneſt perſon to rob the Vatican, and o
ther Libraries of them. But are now at length (maugre Envy and ill Will,) communicated to you, for your Benefit, Farewell.
