# TO THE READER.

After diligent Search for this Book,
having by happy accident met with
it, and procured it for my use;
since I am minded to communicate
it to the Curious and Worthy, I shall give
you some account of the Authors,
and their Work. The Authors are _Kiranus_ and _Harpocration_.
_Kiranus_ was King of _Persia_, to
which Crown none but Magicians could be
admitted, and of which Kingdom the famous
_Zoroastres_ the first Magician, was. This work
of his had been for many Ages turned out of
the _Persian_ into the _Syriack, Arabick,_ and
most Eastern Tongues. _Harpocration_, as the
Learned are of opinion, was a _Græcian_.
There were several of this Name. One of
them wrote a Lexicon upon the Ten Greek
Orators. _Jacobus Maussacus_ published him
with Notes and a critical Discourse upon
him; where he mentions several _Harpocrations_,
and among the rest ours, as the Sequel
will prove. He is at a mighty loss about one _Harpocration_,
whom _Tertullian_ mentions in his Book _De Corona Militis_. _Tertullian_'s Words
are these; _Liberum, eundem apud_ Ægyptios
_Osirin,_ Harpocration _industriá hederatum argumentatur,
quod hedera natura sit cerebrum ab
heluco defensare._ In English thus; _Harpocration
does argue, that_ Bacchus, _the same with_
Osiris _among the_ Ægyptians, _is pictured with
Ivy on purpose, because it is the nature of Ivy
to defend the Brain from Drunkennes._ Now
_Maussacus_, after he had confuted the Mistakes
of several Commentators upon these words
of _Tertullian_, who would make him to mean
_Harpocration_ that wrote the _Lexicon_, comes
to one Commentator, whom he thinks in the
right. These are the Words of _Maussacus_.
"_Jacobus Pamelius_, the last Commentator upon
_Tertullian_, has taken another, and a quite
new course: For he thinks that Harpocration,
whom Tertullian mentions, is the same
with him, whose Manuscript Book πρί φυσικῶν
is kept in the Vatican. And
if we relie on his Credit, _Tertullian_'s words
may not unfitly be accommodated to that
Author, who wrote about the Natural
Virtues of things, since it belongs to Natural
Philosophy to teach, that the Ivy is
sacred to _Bacchus_, because it defends the
Brain from Drunkenness. But I am afraid
small heed is to be given to these things,
and that _Pamèlius_ speaks as an Ear rather
than as an Eye-witness. For I remember I
very carefully perused at _Auspurg_ a Catalogue
of all the Books in the Vatican Library,
lent me by _David Heschœlius_, with
other Catalogues of Libraries at _Auspurg,
Bavaria, Vienna,_ the _Emperor_'s, St. _Mark_ at
_Venice_, and St. _Laurence_ at _Florence_, and
I met not with any thing of _Harpocration_'s
but the Lexicon, neither when I was in the
_Vatican_ at _Rome_, to compare the Printed
_Harpocations_ with a Manuscript that was
there, could I meet with any thing besides
concerning him, nor could I learn
any thing from two _Grecians_, the Father
and the Son, who had the care of writing
out the Manuscript Books, and who have
the Catalogue of that Library by heart.
But I would not have _Pamelius_ therefore
rashly censured, nor his Opinion receded
from, because perhaps, he did not, as from
himself, affirm, that _Harpocration_'s Manuscript
περί φυσικῶν δυνάμεων, was in the Vatican;
but he has been told so by some,
either whose Memory or Honesty failed
them, as by _Simlerus_, who first told him in
his _Epitome Bibliothecæ Gesnerianæ_, that a
Book of _Kirani_ and _Harpocration_
σικῶν δυνάμεων was in the _Vatican_ at _Rome_.
But, till all know more certainly and firmly,
that _Harpocration_'s Book πρί φυσικῶν
is somewhere extant, and till it
is tried, whether that Passage be in him,
which is cited by _Tertullian_, it is my judgment
that the business must hang in suspence,
and the Trial (as Lawyers talk)
must be put off, till another day. For, to
say any thing positively about the Interpretation
of this place, and immediately to
vouch it for Truth, would be no man's act
who remembers he is a Man: It was wittily
said by a wise man of old
άμνησία τό πλέον μέρος όι βροτοῖσιν. _Ignorance is in the greatest
share of Mortals_, which though we find
consentaneous to Truth in other Cases, yet
then most, when we take upon us to open
and interpret some Places in the Writings
of the Ancients, that are controverted, and
not well understood. But the Learned
_Puteans_, while this was in the Press, told
me, they read in a Catalogue, which their
Father had a most compleat one of all the
Libraries in _Italy_, that _Harpocration_'s Book
περί φυσικῶν δυνάμεων, written Alphabetically,
was in the Library of Cardinal St. _Angelo_,
which is now fallen to his Brother
Cardinal _Farnesius_. Which thing, how far
it perswades me, that that Author does not
differ much from ours, I need not declare:
for the Alphabetical order, which we find
he observed, what does it argue, but that
he was a Lexicographer, not much unlike
ours in his way of writing, though he differ
in the Subject? I wish I could obtain
that Treasure, that I might publish it with
this of ours, we should not be so much in
the Dark about this controverted place in
_Tertullian_, and it would presently appear
whether the Author of these two Books
were the same, after which we are so solicitously
inquisitive." Now that Treasure
which _Maussacus_ so much wisht for,
I here offer to you: for it is the Book of _Kirani_
and _Harpocration_, as _Gesner's Bibliotheca_ cites
it; and it goes Alphabetically as _Putean_ says
his _Harpocration_ did in the Cardinal's Library.
And as for the controverted Place in
_Tertullian_, consult but the Letter Θ, _pag_. 26.
of the first Book, and you may be satisfied,
that _Tertullian_ quoted no other _Harpocration_
but ours. Read on to _pag_. 28. and you have
this Passage. _"That you may be without Drunkenness,
and for all favour and health_; In
the Stone _Thyrsites_ engrave the Bird _Thyr_,
and Bacchus holding the Bird, and under
the stone enclose the Root of the Herb,
(meaning _Ivy_) and wear it, and you will
be without Drunkenness, and will have,
Favour with all men; and moreover you
will be without danger in the Palace For
this is a divine _Dionysiack_, and weakens the
strength of _Bacchus_. For so sayes _Harpocration._"
And that learned Father _Tertullian_
sayes, _Harpocration argues_, that Bacchus, _the same with Osiris among the_ Ægyptians, _is pictured
with Ivy on purpose, because it is the Nature
of Ivy to defend the Brain from Drunkenness._
So that _Harpocration_'s and _Tertullian_'s
Sense are altogether the same. And this must
be the Book which no less a Man than _Tertullian_
quoted as an Author, and which many
Learned Men since him have longed to
see, but could not. And _Barthius_, another
Learned Critick of his time, giving an account
of some _Greek_ Physicians, who were
never yet published, strangely extolls _Kirani_.
For whereas others only transcribed one
from another, and little is to be had from any
one of them, that may not be found in _Hippocrates_
and _Galen_; _Kirani_ has many prodigious
Virtues of things both in Medicine, and
other Affairs, contained in the Subjects which
he mentions. _Barthius_ moreover sayes, he
saw this curious Manuscript in the possession
of _Henry Ellenberger_, primary Physician to
the Court at _Magdeburg_, who may very well
be reckoned among the greatest Physicians
of his Age. _Barthius_ would by all means have
had it published, being a Book of such infinite
value: And the rather because it has some
thing of _Harpocration_ in it, who is so highly
and deservedly valued by Learned Men. And
he reckons it to be _Tertullian_'s _Harpocration_,
as _Pamelius_ before him imagined, and as by
comparing the Passages in these two Authors
we have already proved. So that it is not
only my Opinion, but it is the Conjecture of
_Pamelius_, who could not after his most inquisitive
Search and Research, meet with
_Harpocration_; and it is the clear Judgment of
that vastly Learned Man _Barthius_, who saw
_Harpocration_. And I the rather mention _Barthius_,
because this Translation is from a Copy
of that very Manuscript which he saw in
Dr. _Ellenberger_'s hand. Being thus far satisfied
of the Original Authors, our next business
will be to enquire concerning the Translators
of them. _Barthius_ conjectures that the
Translation out of the _Agarene_, or _Arabick_
Language into the _Greek_, was the Work of
a Monk of Constantinople, in the time of _Manuel_
or _Emanuel Comnenus_, the Son of _Calojoannes_;
the Conclusion of whose Life and
Empire was foretold them both in two Greek
Oracles. The Father's in this; Ω πῶς γεννήση βρωμα δεινῶν κοράκαν!
i.e. _Oh, how shalt thou
become the Food of unlucky Crows!_ And
this _Calojoannes_ died somewhere in a place
called in Greek _Crows-Nest_. And the Son's
in this, Αλλ ύς άτη σε κερδανεῖ λόγου, i. e. _Certainly
the last Syllable of a Word shall gain thee._
Now (ηλ) the last Syllable (and the two last
Letters) of Μανουήλ, that Emperor's Name,
signifies Eight and Thirty: And he reigned so
many years. Besides, Historians write, how
at that time the Greek Nation was mightily
addicted to Magick. And so, in all likelihood,
this Greek Interpreter must be well
skilled therein. The next Translation out of
_Greek_ into _Latine_, was made about three or
four hundred years since, by one _Gerardus_, a
most excellent Physitian of that time. _Trithemius_
sirnames him _Fulginas_; _Raphael Volaterranus_,
_Suchonas_; but _Gesner_ and the most
call him _Cremomensit_.

This Latin Translation has been quoted by
many at the second hand. But I never met
with any that saw so much as a Manuscript of
it, till _Barthius_ (as we told you) saw it in
Dr. _Ellenberger_'s Hand, who kept it as a precious
Jewel, and a great Rarity. He had wrote
in the Book with his own Hand, _That he received
this Book in Manuscript, as a singular
Boon, from the most Illustrious Lady, the Lady_
ELEONOR, _Landgravess of_ Hesse, _descended
from the Family of the Dukes of_ Wirtemberg,
_at_ Darmstad, Anno M.DC.IX. This Book
had, about an hundred Years before that, been
in the possession of one _Waltherus de_ VIELBEL,
_Præpositus, S. L._ by whose Donation it belonged
to David _Vielbel_, Anno M.D.XXX. After
Dr. _Ellenberger_'s Death, this Treasure fell
to his Son _Christian William Ellenberger_, who
being a Soldier, bestowed it upon a Physician,
his Acquaintance and Friend. This Physician
printed it privately; for neither his own,
nor the Printer's, nor the place's Name is
printed. But he says, he was forced to leave
the University, and to retire into the Countrey,
by reason of the Plague, of which the
Famous _Sennertus_ died, and he only took this
curious Manuscript with him, and in his Retirement
fitted it for the Press. It bears
Date M.D.C.XXXVIII. So that it seems, but
a few Copies were printed, and those privately
distributed; one of which with some difficulty
I procured.

As for the Book, it seems to be one of that
sort of Books which Men in the _Acts_, who
used curious Arts, brought together, and
burnt, the Price whereof being counted, was
found to be fifty thousand pieces of Silver.
But since such miraculous Zeal is ceased, with
the rest of Miracles, this piece of Curiosity
needs no more undergo Martyrdom, than
Christians now need sell all, and live upon a
common Stock, as they did in the Fourth of
the _Acts_, especially since _Tertullian_, one of the
Fathers, quoted it. It contains, I confess,
much Curiosity in it; but nothing to endammage
Christianity, where it is so firmly settled:
And if there be something that deserves
the Sponge, yet all ought not therefore to be
obliterated; nor must the Child be thrown
away with the Bathe. But the time the Authors
lived in, requires some Grains of Allowance.
And those hidden specifick Vertues of
things, and strange Methods in curing Diseases,
may atone for the Scraps of Vanity and
Superstition that are in the Book. I find, that
former impolite Ages, were nevertheless very
curious in Affairs of Philosophy, and in that
regard surpassed our better cultivated, and
more literate Age. I find also, that great Deference
was given to our Authors: Insomuch
that _Albertus Magnus_ (who is quite spoiled
by unskilful Transcribers) quotes this very
Book. For in _Trinum Magicum_, p. 168, there
is this Passage, _Magicalis cognitio existit in
speculatione rationum, & in speculatione naturalium,
secundum quod antiquis Auctoribus examinavi
& percepi, imo & egomet_ Albertus, _ut in
pluribus veritatem inveni, & veritatem suppomo
(eo modo) quo ab aliquo ex_ CHYRANDIS _libro,
& libro_ ALCHORAT _(sc. eruere licuit)_
Where it is plain enough, that it was first
written CYRANIDIS _libro &_ ARPOCRATIONIS,
and by mistake so miserably depraved.
But since _Albertus_, many learned Men of the
Moderns have made use of _Kirani_, as _Gesner,
Aldrovandu, Balduinus Ronsæus,_ and others.
As for Medicines, I know no Specifick mentioned
by the Ancients, and very few by the
Moderns, which he has not, besides many
that are to be met with no where else. But
because for some Ages past, to have been a
Magician, or a Wise Man, was Capital, it will
be necessary to remove some Prejudices received
against Magick or Wisdom, which I
think cannot better be done, than by shewing
what true Magick or Wisdom is, and how far
is is consistent with the Holy Scriptures, which
seem most to condemn it. Now, Magick I
take to be _a skill which by a certain Power, yet
not supernatural, but created, is able to do unusual
things, whose Causes are beyond the common
Comprehension of Men._ In this Definition we
exclude Miracles, as supernaturally wrought
by the Finger of GOD. And by excluding
from it all Diabolical Contract, we must intend
no other than Magick purely natural, or
the Skill of managing Nature by Art, so as
to accomplish strange things. We know it
was the Ambition of Knowledge that ruined
our First Parents; but they had to do in that
Affair with the Devil. And I make no doubt,
but they had the Knowledge of Good, before
they tasted of the Tree of Knowledge of
Good and Evil, the latter part whereof has almost
obliterated the former in their posterity,
though the former is that which we aim at,
and which _Adam_ undoubtedly had in his Innocency.
For all the Learned hold him to
have had an exact Knowledge of the Vertues
of things before the Fall. And this Knowledge
was delivered from Father to Son before
the Flood, till _Seth_ engraved it on Pillars,
and so by those Monuments, as well as
by _Noah_'s oral Tradition, the Post-Diluvians
were instructed in the same. _Abraham_
is said to have had skill in Astrology. And
the Scriptures testifie, what skill in the Magick
of Imagination his Grand-son _Jacob_ had, from
his pilled Rods, that he set before the Flocks,
when they conceived. _Moses_ is not only accounted
a Magician by Heathen Writers, but
the Scriptures testifie, how he was learned in
all the Wisdom of the _Ægyptians_, whereof
Magick was no small Share, as their Magicians
working Wonder for Wonder with _Moses_,
a little while, prove.

We read also of wise Charming in the Psalms,
of which sort of Charming we have a Form in
this Book, _pag_. 152. And if we should narrowly
enquire into all the Books of Scripture, we
might perceive, that the Authors of them
were skilled in the power of Nature, as well
as of Godliness, the former whereof, was, and
is called Magick. Nay, the _Magi_ of the East,
were more devout in following their Star, to
worship our Saviour, than all the Nation of
the Jews. So that Magick (unless with _Jannes_,
and _Jambres_, we use it in opposition against
GOD) is not only lawful, but commendable.

But whereas _Kirani_ undertakes to cast out,
and drive away evil Spirits by natural Means,
this is but what _Tobias_ in the _Apocrypha_ did by
the persuasion of the Angel: For _he remembred
the words of_ Raphael, _and took coals for perfumes,
and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish
thereupon, and made a perfume. The which smell
when the evil Spirit had smelled, he fled into the
utmost parts of_ Ægypt, _whom the Angel bound._
The Angel likewise told _Tobias_, that _as for
the Gall, anoynt a Man that has Whiteness in his
Eyes, and he shall be healed._ And _he took hold
of his Father, and sprinkled of the Gall in his
Fathers Eyes, saying, be of good hope my Father.
And when his Eyes began to prick, he rubbed them;
And the Whiteness pilled away from the corners of
his Eyes, and then he saw his Son._ Now _Kirani_
so far explains the _Apocrypha_, as to tell us
the Heart, the Liver and the Gall of what
Fish it is, that does these things.

I remember, I have heard of a Physician,
eminent for the cure of Lunaticks, who is said
to have used suffumigations or perfumes of
something in his Cures. And such you may
meet with here.

You must take notice, that in the first Book,
in the concatenation of the Vertues of
things according to the four _Elements_, the
Plants are analogous to Earth, Fishes to Water,
Birds to Air, and Stones to Fire. For
Nature's Interpreters do ascribe miraculous
Virtues to Gemmus; and without doubt those
efficacious and abstruse properties descend from
a peculiar influence of the Stars, and a better
temperament of the Elements. And is it a
great Argument it is so, because in the Eastern
Countries, where the Sun is hottest, the best
Stones are found. And therefore _Kirani_ ascribes
fiery Virtues to Stones, and makes one
to be under one Planet, and another under
another. But it were endless to give an account
of all the Rarities herein contained.
Therefore with Piety and Wisdom peruse
these four Books themselves. The Worth and
Rarity whereof, I am afraid, has tempted some
dishonest person to rob the _Vatican_, and other
Libraries of them. But are now at length
(maugre Envy and ill Will,) communicated to
you, for your Benefit, Farewell.
