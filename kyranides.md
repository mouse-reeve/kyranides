### Letter I. A.

{G} the white Vine. {G}, the Eagle, a Bird. {G}, the Eagle-stone. {G}, the Eagle, a Fish without Scales.

{G} is a molt holy and admirable Herb; it is also divine, and is called {G}, Bryony. The Male-Eagle is King of all Birds. The Eagle-stone is with Child and Rattles. The Eagle, a Fish without Scales, is like the Hawkfish, only somewhat blacker, and like a little Thorn-back.

 For _Convulsions and Epilepsies_; Now the Root of the Herb worn about the Neck, cures People of Convulsions and the falling Sickness.

_For the bloody Flux, and spitting of Blood_; And four Spoonfulls of the Juice given to any in a bloody Flux cure him.

_Against Drunkenness_; And if a man, otherwise well, have a mind to drink much Drink, let him drink of the Juice of the Leaves (??? fj. ???) and as much Vinegar fasting.

_That one be not made drunk_; And if one drink the Stone that is in the Head of the Fish, with Wine, he shall not perceive at all what he drinks. And if he carry the Stone about his Neck, without the Herb, if he drink a Gallon of strong Wine, he shall not perceive it.

_To make Excretion_. The Stones, when the Grapes are prest out, bruised with a little of the said Stone, and given in Drink to such as have paralytick Genitals, will make them stand. And it is good for them that cannot perform the Act of Generation.

_For broken Bones of the Hands, and bloody Fluxes, and any Disease of the Arse. And GOD himself gave this, that mortal Body might not fail._ Take of White Wine a Pint and an half, with the tender Buds of the Herb XL, and Coriars Galls (??? §iij ???). Boyl two thirds away; this cures Dysenteries and Lienterics, and broken Bones of the hands, and every Disease of the Arse, and every such thing, if it be drunk. A Decoction of the Leaves also, drunk with a little Honey, asswawages every Disease of the Neck: And if you add a little of the Stone, that Disease will neither encrcase, nor return again. I have seen several, who have had their Bones crushed, and I admired how they were cured. One can testifie this, who was twenty five years old, and is now restored without pain by this Divine Medicine and Nature: Nor indeed were there any Hands before; all the Flesh was withered upon one, nor had it any Sense; but all the Members besides had their feeling.

_Also to make broken Bones whole, I found in this Sacred Book thus:_ Give the Juice of the Leaves of the Herb, and as much white Wine mixt with it, to drink for seven days. And the Eagle-Stone worn about one, and the Fish eaten, do the same thing. _Keep this Gist of GOD, and give it not to thine own Son!_

_For the Thumbs and incurable Nails_: When the Nail of the Thumb falls, and is incurable, and is alwayes running, infuse Dates bruised in white Wine, and lay them sometimes on alone, chewed, and sometimes with Oyl of Roses.

_For Warts_: And for Warts, which come either all over the Body, or in any Part, burn the Branches or Wood of Vine, and apply the Water that comes out with the Smoak of the Vine-Leaf, or give it to drink, and they will all fall off: _Teach man this!_ So the Dung of an Eagle applied, will cure: The Stone applied, and the Fat of the Fish anointed, does also cure.

_For Putrefaction of the Gums, and the Jaws, and for cancerous and eating Ulcers in the whole Body._ Of the Juice of the Leaves (???). Alum (???). crude Misy (???). Manna (???). Illyrick Iris (???). Vitriol (???). dissolved till they be dry; for this purges and fills ulcerous and eating Sores, and it stops a supervening Inflammation. And this is far greater.

_For Putrefaction of the Tongue, and Mortification of the Gums_. But now we tell you something that is great. We saw something marcid and cancerous in the Tongue, which was like also to mortifie the Gumsl therefore by applying the Juice of the Leaves mixt with Honey, it was cured; then strewing on dry _Iris_, the Ulcer filled up.

_For all Breaches, and a_ Polypus, _and Frettings, and Eatings, and Humors, and whatever happens about the Nose, a Divine Medicine_. Of the Juice of the Leaves (???). Manna, Vitriol, Frankincense, _Misy_ (?), _Aristolochia_, each three ounces: Rub them till all is dry, and use the Divine Virtue.

_For Baldness and Shedding of the Hair, Sores, Scars, and any Diseases about the Head_: Apple the Juice of the Herb and the Juice of _Potamogeiton_, and the Juice of _Seseli_ skillfully mixt, anoynt for three days.

_A Divine Medicine to keep the Teeth sound and firm, which I would not keep from you_. Of the Juice of the Grapes (???). or viii Spoonfulls, the Bark of Mulbery-Tree Root (???). Boyl it to half, and give it to wash the Mouth for three or five or seven days, and your Teeth will never ake. If one will diligently confider, the Vine will cure all Diseases from the Head to the Feet. This Herb is called _THEOdorica_, i. e. _Given of GOD_.

_Kiranus and Harpocration_ do thus far agree. Then _Kiranus_ brings something new, and says, _For Urine and Stool_; The Sprouts, I say, of the first Budding of this Herb, boyled and eaten, provoke Urine and Stool. But both the Leaves, and the Root, and the Fruit have a very hot and sharp Virtue.

_For the King's Evil, and eating Flesh, and putrid Ulcers and Gangrenes_. And it has also another very famous Virtue and Divine Efficacy; for it cures the King's Evil, and putrid Ulcers and Gangrenes, and eating Sores, made up with _Aristolochia_ into Plaster. And its Root rosted brings a good Colour into the Face, and a tender Skin.

_And it takes out Moles, Corns, and Freckles_; Mixt with Flower of bitter Vetch and Fœnugreek, it takes away Corns, Freckles and black Moles. And boiled with Oyl till it congeals, it congeals, it is good for the same. And the Root broken in Wine, takes away Lividness of the Eyes and Whitlows.

_For a Swelling_. It an ends any Ulcer of the Genitals, and dissipates and disperses Swellings.

_For the Epilepsie_. An ounce of it given every day for a Year with _Oxymel_, cures it.

_For the Apoplexy and Swimming in the Head, and Biting of Serpents, and Miscarriage_. It is also good for Apoplectick and Vertiginous Persons: Give (???), and it quickly cures such as are bitten by Serpents; It corrupts the Birth also, and disturbs the Belly and the Sense; and applied, it brings away the Secundine, and drunk, it moves Urine. Eighteen grains of it drunk for thirty days, wastes the Spleen. Made into a Plaster with Figs, it is good for the same. It is boyled for hot Insessions for purging of the _Matrix_. It also moderately purgeth the Belly. And its Fruit in an Oyntment and Plaster, is good for the Scurf and Leprosie. The Juice of the Herb drunk in Broth, causes Milk. Drunk and anointed with Oyl, it is good for Epaticks. Its Leaves also in a Cataplasm with Wine, are good for all Ulcers. And applied, they are good for Rheumatick Swellings. And we may say further, _It is good for all things to him that useth it with Caution._

And there are two sorts of it. The first is called the white Vine, which some call Bryony, others Snake-Grape; others Celidonia, others {G} others {G}, others {G}, others Kethedron. The Buds, and Leaves, and Claspers of this are like the Domestick Vine, but they are thicker, and implicated With the adjacent Fruits, catching with their Claspers; and it has a red Grape-like Fruit, wherewith Hides have their Hair fetcht off, or are prepared. And the second sort of it is called the _black Vine_, which they also call Bryony; and some {G}, having Leaves like Ivy, but the great ones like Bind-weed, but greater; this also applies itself to, and takes hold of Trees with its Clafpers. And its Fruit is like Grapes; they are green in the beginning, and when they are ripe, they are black without, but like Box within. And its Sprouts also at the first budding may be boyled like Pot-herbs; and they are diuretick, and force the _Menstrua_; they cure the Spleen. The Roots are very good for Splenetick Persons, and the whole Herb is proper for such as are Epileptick and Vertiginous. And its Leaf in a Cataplasm with Wine, is good to eat away proud Flesh, and for wrested and dislocated Limbs, and for Relaxations; and further, it has a Virtue like to the former. And the white Vine has other Efficacies secular and delightful, so that being applied, it does not only give any man Sobriety, but causes Delight.

_So says_ Kiranus _this place_, After the Dissonance of them both, there began _Harpocration_ his Speech: _O blessed Herb! Conducter of the Gods, and a Royal Conducter, more powerful than all Herbs, having the Principality of Earth, and Heaven, and Air, and dissolving all Power! O Grape bearing Drink! maist thou loosen the Limbs, cause Sleep! No Speech nor Body shall expel thee; but thou findest out whatever things are in the Minds of Mortals, and what Mysteries they have hidden in their Mind. The Vine makes manifest all Secrets, and all things hat shall be concealed by Writing, or by Medicine, or by Enchantment, or by the Sword, or by Science: For these may be said to be the Mysteries of the Vine._ And it has other mundane things also which are not unprofitable to Mortals, yea they bring Delight and Joy. Therefor thus I read on: The holy Speech, as Kirani has it. _For Joy and Exultation._ O Blessed Queen bestowed of GOD, most holy Mother, and more Divine than all Plants! first Nature affects the Grape, the Grape makes heavenly wine! Before you have said this, send the Cup, Bowl or Flagon about, of which all do drink, and they break out in Joy, no man complaining or asking. For {G}, i. e. _Exultation_. The Juice of the Grape drunk causes great Joy. Plant it in every place. For neither the Solemnities of the Gods, nor of Mortals, who have a term in their Life; nor what things in Life do come, nor what things now go out, nor some of those things that are acted in Life, can be done without this Plant. Also occult things require planting of it.

_For people troubles with Quartane Agnes_; It yet remains for me to speak if the certain _Cacodemon_ (or evil Spirit) which is call'd a Quartanary, who is not easily conquered by five Fortitudes of the first Decan of _Capricorn_, because he sees not, nor hears, for he is without a Head. Therefore take the Grape having four Seeds, take out the Kernels with your Nails, and not with your Mouth, and put them in a course Cloth, and hang them about your Neck, and it will cause Health. And the Stone that is in the Head of the Fish, hung about the Neck, takes away a Quartane. Therefore take the Eagle-Stone, and engrave also an Eagle upon it, and under the Stone put the Kernels of the Grape, and the top of the Feathers of an Eagles wing; and if you have not an Eagle, of an Hawks, and enclosing it, wear it. For it will preserve you from all the foresaid Occasions of Evil: Moreover it will give you power to speak, and to have friendly conferences with Great Men; and it is good for many other things; all which I will not declare.


### LETTER II. {Greek G}

{G} is a Bird which is called {G} i. e. _a Crow_, a common Animal, and known to all People, living to five hundred years of age. {G} is a precious Stone, a Beril which is called {G} i. e. _All Life_. {G} is a _Sea-Lobster_, so called from its likeness to {G}, i. e. red Tiles. {G}, i. e. The Herb Sevine, known to all People.

_For Dyspnoïck, Orthopnoïck and Asthmatic Persons:_ Make this Electuary; Of Savine (???). Butter (???). Honey (???). Mix, and give it a fasting (tasting?).

_For any Infirmity of the Eye_; Crab hung about the Neck, cure all Infirmities of the Eye. And the Bird hath the same Nature; for if the Female dies, the Male will not pair with another; and the Female does the same.

_For Love between a Man and his Wife_. If a Man carry the Heart of a Male Crow, and a Woman the Heart of the Female, they will agree between themselves all their Life-time; and this Miracle is certain.

_For Dyspnoïck, Epilseptick, and Nephritick People_. Take, I say, one Beril Stone and engrave a Crow upon it, and under its feet a Crab; enclose also a little Savine, and a little of the Heart of a Bird under the Stone, wear it as you will: for it is good for Dypsnoick, Epileptick and Nephritick Persons.

_For Joy and Exultation, and Acquisition (?) and Union, and Conjugal Love_: And it will make the Bearer chearful and rich: And it is as excellent as any thing for lascivious and conjugal Love.



### Letter III. (???).

{G}, _the Herb Pæony_. {G} a sort of Owl. {G}, a Stone. {G} a Sea-fish known to all men.

_Glykiside_ is the Herb _Pæon_; and it has a Fruit like the Gum of an Almond Tree. Some of its Seeds are open, and other close. _Glaux_ is a Bird which is ascribed to _Pallos_; it has a Crown of Feathers upon its Head, and great Eyes like a Night-Raven, living in the Fields. _Gnanthius_ is a Stone as hard as a Milstone, like a Granate. _Glaucus_ is a Sea-Fish, known to all men. Now there are two sorts of the Herb, Female and Male.

_That a Woman may conceive_: If therefore a Woman do not retain the Man's Seed, and would conceive, let her be girt with the close Seeds of the Divine Herb, trying it in a Linnen Cloth died of seven Colours; let it be put about her Twist.

_That she may not conceive_; But if she have no mind to conceive, let her gird her self with the open Seeds, and the Way of a Mules Ear; as long as she pleases.

_For casie (?) Travail_: But if there be danger in the Pains of Birth, bruise the open Seed, and make it up with Oyl, and (?) and anoint the Loyns and Twist, and she will bear without pain.

_To chase away Devils and Phantasms_: And its Root in Fume or in Drink, expels Devils and all (?) Phantasms, and being worm, it does the same.

_For a Miracle_. The Eyes of the Bird _Glaux_ and of the Fish _Glaucus_, bruise them with a little Sea-water, and put them in a GLass bottle. But it is better to dissolve the G??? of them both, and to keep it in a Glass bottle. And when you would have the Virtue of Nature to be admired, Parchments must be written with the foresaid soft Collyrium, and in the day indeed it will not appear; but when it is dark, that which is written must be read. And, if you please, draw any _Animal_ upon the wall, and when Night comes they that are in the dark shall think what they see is either Devils or Gods.

_That one may seem strong, and glorious, and faithful to men, and that he may see true Dreams_. And if any one will engrave upon the Stone _Gnanthius_ the Bird _Glaux_, and under its Feet the Fish, and under these enclose the Eyes, and wear it, abstaining from Swines Flesh and from uncleanness, when it is dark he shall appear an elegant Man; therefore those that see him, shall think him Divine. In the day time also whatsoever he sayes, he shall be believed in it. And has in bed it will shew true Visions.



### Letter IV. {Greek delta}.

_Draconthea, the Herb Dragons_. {G}, _the Bird Woodpecker_. _Draco, a Fish_. _Dendritis, a Tree stone_.

_Draconthea_ is an Herb, having Seed like the eyes of a Dragon, bread leaves, is bad altogether. The _Woodpecker_ is a Bird known to all, as big as a Quail, it perforates Oaks, Olive trees and Nut trees, that it may make a Nest in the middle of the Wood. The _Dragon_ is a Sea fish without scales: After therefore that it has voided much, and would also(?) over great violence, the Cloud of Heaven snatch it into the Air, and dash it against the Mountains, tearing it Limb from Limb, so that is it no more.

_That one be not hurt_; It is two forked, like a Horses Tail, two fingers in length. Putting it in Oyl, keep it. Putting it in Oyl indeed, it preserves all People from fascination and infirmity. For I saw this upon the Sea coasts of the _Assyrian_ Countrey. _Dendrites_ is a Stone, which is known by many; This grows in India in Rocky maritime places about six fingers high.

_For Hearing_; The Seed of the Herb _Draconthea_ worn sharpens the Sight and removes a little pain in the Head. The Feather also of the Bird, with a little of the Stone Dendrites, cures the _Hemicrania_ or half Head-ach. In like manner the Feather of the Bird, and a little of the Fish bruised and applied, suddenly cures every Head-ach. Let us not therefore mistake for the difficult finding of the great _Draconthea_ but those things which are done, are from the little Draconthea , which is two hand breadths high, and it is as the Fish or the Serpent, and we put this for the other.

_For a {G}, or a Flesh Dropsie, and a {G}, or Leprosie of the_ Arabians, _and any Leprosie_. For a pain in the Head, and the beginning of an _Elephantia_ and _Leprosie_ and any breaking out of the Skin, the Fa(?) of the Dragon-Fish with the Juice of the Herb, anoynt morning and evening.

_To open Doors, Locks, Dolts, and to tame wild Beasts and to be beloved of all, and to acquire all(?) things, that whatever you please may be done for you_. And if one obtain the hole of Tree, in which the young ones of the Wood pecker are, he shall carry the Herb which knows, and touching it opens; For if it be made of Clay or Chalk, the dirt will fall: If of Stone it bursts: If a wooden Board or iron Plate be so fastned with Nails, all things cleave and break in pieces upon the touch of the Herb, and the Woodpecker opens and takes out her young ones. If any one therefore have got this Herb, he will do many things, which are not now lawful to mention, as of the mod Divine Nature, which Man cannot perform. If therefore any man engrave a Woodpecker in the Stone _Dendrites_, and a Sea-Dragon under its feet, and enclose the Herb underneath it, which the Woodpecker found and carried, every Gate will open to him, and Bolts and Locks. Salvage Beasts will also obey him, and come to tameness; he shall also be beloved and observed of all, and whatsoever he hath a mind to, he shall acquire and perform. _Mercury_ was a most accursed Pagan, and was worshipped as a God : but I worship _Christ_, and do unwillingly write of _Mercury_. _O the Blessedness of the Gods!_ _Mercury_ is an Animal unknown to GOD, and also his Nature. For who can find out the generation of Men? He is not, yea, a deceiver, Thou art wife, and instructing hast given understanding in the Pillar, _Thus far Nature_. But he that carries it, shall learn those things that are in the Gods, shall open Locks, and loose Chains, shall pacifie all wild Beasts by the will which is in Heaven, shall asswage the waves of the terrible Sea, shall chase away all Devils, and shall appear good to all men. But we will alter for the purpose. If perchance you should not find the Herb, which opens the shut Nest of the Woodpecker, enclose under the engraven Stone the top of a Feather of the Birds wings and the Heart, and one feed of the Herb _Draconthea_, and the Stone or the Brain of the Fish. For being so carried, they give sharp-sightedness to the Eyes, cure the Head-ach, and expel all Diseases of the Eyes and Head from the Bearer. Moreover they represent him rich and potent to all Men.
