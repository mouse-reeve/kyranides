## LETTER I. A.

_[Άμπελος λευκή](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B2%CF%81%CF%85%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%AF%CE%B1) the white Vine. [ἀετός](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%B5%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%82), the
Eagle, a Bird. 'Aετίτης, the Eagle-stone.
Aετός, the Eagle, a Fish without Scales._

_Άμπελος λευκή_ is a most holy and admirable
Herb; it is also divine, and is called _βρυωνία,
Bryony_. The Male-Eagle is King of all Birds.
The Eagle-stone is with Child and Rattles. The
Eagle, a Fish without Scales, is like the Hawkfish,
only somewhat blacker, and like a little
Thorn-back. For _Convulsions and Epilepsies_;
Now the Root of the Herb worn about the
Neck, cures People of Convulsions and the falling
Sickness. _For the bloody Flux, and spitting
of Blood_; And four Spoonfulls of the
Juice given to any in a bloody Flux cure him.
_Against Drunkenness_; And if a man, otherwise
well, have a mind to drink much Drink,
let him drink of the Juice of the Leaves ℥j.
and as much Vinegar fasting. _That one be
not made drunk_; And if one drink the Stone
that is in the Head of the Fish, with Wine,
he shall not perceive at all what he drinks.
And if he carry the Stone about his Neck,
without the Herb, if he drink a Gallon of
strong Wine, he shall not perceive it. _To
make Excretion_. The Stones, when the
Grapes are prest out, bruised with a little of
the said Stone, and given in Drink to such as
have paralytick Genitals, will make them stand.
And it is good for them that cannot perform
the Act of Generation. _For broken Bones of
the Hands, and bloody Fluxes, and any Disease
of the Arse. And GOD himself gave this, that
mortal Body might not fail._ Take of White
Wine a Pint and an half, with the tender
Buds of the Herb XL, and Coriars Galls ℥iij.
Boyl two thirds away; this cures Dysenteries
and Lienteries, and broken Bones of the hands,
and every Disease of the Arse, and every such
thing, if it be drunk. A Decoction of the
Leaves also, drunk with a little Honey, asswages
every Disease of the Neck: And if you
add a little of the Stone, that Disease will
neither encrease, nor return again. I have
seen several, who have had their Bones crushed,
and I admired how they were cured.
One can testifie this, who was twenty five
years old, and is now restored without pain
by this Divine Medicine and Nature: Nor
indeed were there any Hands before; all the
Flesh was withered upon one, nor had it any Sense;
but all the Members besides had
their feeling. _Also to make broken Bones whole,
I found in this Sacred Book thus:_ Give the
Juice of the Leaves of the Herb, and as much
white Wine mixt with it, to drink for seven
days. And the Eagle-Stone worn about one,
and the Fish eaten, do the same thing. _Keep
this Gist of GOD, and give it not to thine own
Son!_ _For the Thumbs and incurable Nails_:
When the Nail of the Thumb falls, and is incurable,
and is alwayes running, infuse Dates
bruised in white Wine, and lay them sometimes
on alone, chewed, and sometimes with
Oyl of Roses. _For Warts_: And for Warts,
which come either all over the Body, or in
any Part, burn the Branches or Wood of
Vine, and apply the Water that comes out
with the Smoak of the Vine-Leaf, or give it
to drink, and they will all fall off: _Teach
man this!_ So the Dung of an Eagle applied,
will cure: The Stone applied, and the Fat
of the Fish anointed, does also cure. _For
Putrefaction of the Gums, and the Jaws, and for
cancerous and eating Ulcers in the whole Body._
Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iij. Alum ℥iv.
crude _Misy_ ℥iv. Manna ℥iv. Illyrick Iris ℥j.
Vitriol ℥iv. dissolved till they be dry; for
this purges and fills ulcerous and eating Sores,
and it stops a supervening Inflammation. And
this is far greater. _For Putrefaction of the
Tongue, and Mortification of the Gums_. But
now we tell you something that is great. We
saw something marcid and cancerous in the
Tongue, which was like also to mortifie the
Gums; therefore by applying the Juice of
the Leaves mixt with Honey, it was cured;
then strewing on dry _Iris_, the Ulcer filled
up. _For all Breaches, and a_ Polypus, _and
Frettings, and Eatings, and Humors, and
whatever happens about the Nose, a Divine Medicine_.
Of the Juice of the Leaves ℥iv. Manna,
Vitriol, Frankincense, _Misy_, _Aristolochia_,
each three ounces: Rub them till all is dry,
and use the Divine Virtue. _For Baldness and
Shedding of the Hair, Sores, Scars, and any
Diseases about the Head_: Apply the Juice of
the Herb and the Juice of _Potamogeiton_, and
the Juice of _Seseli_ skillfully mixt, anoynt for
three days. _A Divine Medicine to keep the Teeth
sound and firm, which I would not keep from
you_. Of the Juice of the Grapes ℥j. or viii
Spoonfuls, the Bark of Mulbery-Tree Root
℥vj. Boyl it to half, and give it to wash the
Mouth for three or five or seven days, and
your Teeth will never ake. If one will diligently
consider, the Vine will cure all Diseases
from the Head to the Feet. This Herb
is called _THEOdorica_, i.e. _Given of GOD_.
_Kiranus_ and _Harpocration_ do thus far agree.

Then _Kiranus_ brings something new, and
says, _For Urine and Stool_; The Sprouts, I
say, of the first Budding of this Herb, boyled
and eaten, provoke Urine and Stool. But
both the Leaves, and the Root, and the Fruit
have a very hot and sharp Virtue. _For the
King's Evil, and eating Flesh, and putrid Ulcers
and Gangrenes_. And it has also another
very famous Virtue and Divine Efficacy; for
it cures the King's Evil, and putrid Ulcers and
Gangrenes, and eating Sores, made up with
_Aristolochia_ into Plaster. And its Root rosted
brings a good Colour into the Face, and a
tender Skin. _And it takes out Moles, Corns, and
Freckles;_ Mixt with Flower of bitter Vetch
and Fœnugreek, it takes away Corns, Freckles
and black Moles. And boiled with Oyl
till it congeals, it is good for the same. And
the Root broken in Wine, takes away Lividness
of the Eyes and Whitlows. _For a Swelling_.
It an ends any Ulcer of the Genitals, and
dissipates and disperses Swellings. _For the
Epilepsie_. An ounce of it given every day for
a Year with _Oxymel_, cures it. _For the Apoplexy
and Swimming in the Head, and Biting of
Serpents, and Miscarriage_. It is also good for
Apoplectick and Vertiginous Persons: Give
℥ij, and it quickly cures such as are bitten by
Serpents; It corrupts the Birth also, and disturbs
the Belly and the Sense; and applied,
it brings away the Secundine, and drunk, it
moves Urine. Eighteen grains of it drunk
for thirty days, wastes the Spleen. Made into
a Plaster with Figs, it is good for the
same. It is boyled for hot Insessions for purging
of the _Matrix_. It also moderately purgeth
the Belly. And its Fruit in an Oyntment
and Plaster, is good for the Scurf and Leprosie.
The Juice of the Herb drunk in Broth,
causes Milk. Drunk and anointed with Oyl,
it is good for Epaticks. Its Leaves also in a
Cataplasm with Wine, are good for all Ulcers.
And applied, they are good for Rheumatick
Swellings. And we may say further,
_It is good for all things to him that useth it with
Caution._

And there are two sorts of it. The first is
called the white Vine, which some call Bryony,
others Snake-Grape; others Celidonia, others
_[μίλητον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BC%B0%CF%83%CE%AC%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BE%CE%B9%CF%82)_ others
_[ψίλωθρον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%88%CE%AF%CE%BB%CF%89%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD)_, others _αρχισωστικη_,
others _Kethedron_. The Buds, and Leaves,
and Claspers of this are like the Domestick
Vine, but they are thicker, and implicated
With the adjacent Fruits, catching with their
Claspers; and it has a red Grape-like Fruit,
wherewith Hides have their Hair fetcht off,
or are prepared. And the second sort of it
is called the _black Vine_, which they also call
Bryony; and some _[χειρώνιον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%A7%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CF%89%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%AC%CF%82)_, having Leaves
like Ivy, but the great ones like Bind-weed,
but greater; this also applies itself to, and
takes hold of Trees with its Claspers. And its
Fruit is like Grapes; they are green in the
beginning, and when they are ripe, they are
black without, but like Box within. And its
Sprouts also at the first budding may be boyled
like Pot-herbs; and they are diuretick,
and force the _Menstrua_; they cure the Spleen.
The Roots are very good for Splenetick Persons,
and the whole Herb is proper for such
as are Epileptick and Vertiginous. And its
Leaf in a Cataplasm with Wine, is good to
eat away proud Flesh, and for wrested and
dislocated Limbs, and for Relaxations; and
further, it has a Virtue like to the former.

And the white Vine has other Efficacies
secular and delightful, so that being applied,
it does not only give any man Sobriety, but
causes Delight. _So says_ Kiranus _this place_,
After the Dissonance of them both, there began
_Harpocration_ his Speech: _O blessed Herb!
Conducter of the Gods, and a Royal Conducter,
more powerful than all Herbs, having the Principality
of Earth, and Heaven, and Air, and
dissolving all Power! O Grape bearing Drink!
maist thou loosen the Limbs, cause Sleep! No
Speech nor Body shall expel thee; but thou
findest out whatever things are in the Minds of
Mortals, and what Mysteries they have hidden
in their Mind. The Vine makes manifest
all Secrets, and all things that shall be concealed
by Writing, or by Medicine, or by Enchantment,
or by the Sword, or by Science: For
these may be said to be the Mysteries of the
Vine._ And it has other mundane things also
which are not unprofitable to Mortals, yea
they bring Delight and Joy. Therefor thus
I read on: The holy Speech, as Kirani had
it. _For Joy and Exultation._ O Blessed Queen
bestowed of GOD, most holy Mother, and
more Divine than all Plants! first Nature affects
the Grape, the Grape makes heavenly
Wine! Before you have said this, send the
Cup, Bowl or Flagon about, of which all do
drink, and they break out in Joy, no man
complaining or asking. For _ἐνοχία_ (?), i.e. _Exultation_.
The Juice of the Grape drunk
causes great Joy. Plant it in every place.
For neither the Solemnities of the Gods, nor
of Mortals, who have a term in their Life;
nor what things in Life do come, nor what
things now go out, nor some of those things
that are acted in Life, can be done without
this Plant. Also occult things require the
planting of it. _For people troubles with Quartane
Agnes_; It yet remains for me to speak
of the certain _Cacodemon_ (or evil Spirit) which
is call'd a Quartanary, who is not easily conquered
by five Fortitudes of the first Decan
of _Capricorn_, because he sees not, nor hears;
for he is without a Head. Therefore take the
Grape having four Seeds, take out the Kernels
with your Nails, and not with your
Mouth, and put them in a course Cloth,
and hang them about your Neck, and it will
cause Health. And the Stone that is in the
Head of the Fish, hung about the Neck, takes
away a Quartane. Therefore take the Eagle-Stone,
and engrave also an Eagle upon it,
and under the Stone put the Kernels of the
Grape, and the top of the Feathers of an
Eagles wing; and if you have not an Eagle,
of an Hawks, and enclosing it, wear it. For
it will preserve you from all the foresaid Occasions
of Evil: Moreover it will give you
power to speak, and to have friendly conferences
with Great Men; and it is good for
many other things; all which I will not declare.


## LETTER II. Γ.

_βοροσίτης_ is a Bird which is called _[Κορώνη](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%8E%CE%BD%CE%B7)_
i.e. _a Crow_, a common Animal, and known
to all People, living to five hundred years
of age. _Βήρυλλιο_ is a precious Stone, a Beril;
which is called _πάνζωον_ i.e. _All Life_. _Βίασας_,
is a _Sea-Lobster_, so called from its likeness to
_Βησαλα_, i.e. red Tiles. _Binthi_, i.e. The Herb
_Savine_, known to all People.

_For Dyspnoïck, Orthopnoïck and Asthmatick
Persons:_ Make this Electuary; Of Savine ℥j.
Butter ℥iv. Honey ℥iij. Mix, and give it a fasting [sic].
_For any Infirmity of the Eye_; Crabs
hung about the Neck, cure all Infirmities
of the Eye. And the Bird hath the same Nature;
for if the Female dies, the Male will
not pair with another; and the Female does
the same. _For Love between a Man and his
Wife_. If a Man carry the Heart of a Male
Crow, and a Woman the Heart of the Female,
they will agree between themselves
all their Life-time; and this Miracle is certain.
_For Dyspnoïck, Epileptick, and Nephritick
People_. Take, I say, one Beril Stone,
and engrave a Crow upon it, and under its
feet a Crab; enclose also a little Savine,
and a little of the Heart of a Bird under the
Stone, wear it as you will: for it is good
for Dypsnoïck, Epileptick and Nephritick
Persons. _For Joy and Exultation, and Acquisition
and Union, and Conjugal Love_: And
it will make the Bearer chearful and rich:
And it is as excellent as any thing for lascivious
and conjugal Love.



## LETTER III. Γ.

_[Γλυκυσίδη](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B3%CE%BB%CF%85%CE%BA%CF%85%CF%83%CE%AF%CE%B4%CE%B7), the Herb Pæony.
[Γλαύξ](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%B1%CF%8D%CE%BE) a sort
of Owl. Γνάνθιος, a Stone. [Γλαῦκος](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B3%CE%BB%CE%B1%E1%BF%A6%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%82), a Sea-fish
known to all men._

_Glykiside_ is the Herb _Pæony_; and it is called
_Pæony_, from its Inventor _Pæon_; and it has
a Fruit like the Gum of an Almond Tree.
Some of its Seeds are open, and other close.
_Glaux_ is a Bird which is ascribed to _Pallos_;
it has a Crown of Feathers upon its Head,
and great Eyes like a Night-Raven, living in
the Fields. _Gnanthius_ is a Stone as hard as a
Milstone, like a Granate. _Glaucus_ is a Sea-Fish,
known to all men. Now there are
two sorts of the Herb, Female and Male.
_That a Woman may conceive_: If therefore a
Woman do not retain the Man's Seed, and
would conceive, let her be girt with the
close Seeds of the Divine Herb, tying it in
a Linnen Cloth died of seven Colours; let
it be put about her Twist. _That she may not
conceive_; But if she have no mind to conceive,
let her gird her self with the open
Seeds, and the Way of a Mules Ear; as long
as she pleases. _For easie Travail_: But if there
be danger in the Pains of Birth, bruise the
open Seed, and make it up with Oyl, and
and [sic] anoint the Loyns and Twist, and she
will bear without pain. _To chase away Devils
and Phantasms_: And its Root in
Fume or in Drink, expels Devils and all
Phantasms, and being worn, it does the same.
_For a Miracle_. The Eyes of the Bird _Glaux_,
and of the Fish _Glaucus_, bruise them with a
little Sea-water, and put them in a Glass-bottle.
But it is better to dissolve the Gall
of them both, and to keep it in a Glass-bottle.
And when you would have the Virtue
of Nature to be admired, Parchments must be
written with the foresaid soft _Collyrium_, and
in the day indeed it will not appear; but
when it is dark, that which is written may
be read. And, if you please, draw any _Animal_
upon the wall, and when Night comes,
they that are in the dark shall think what they
see is either Devils or Gods. _That one may
seem strong, and glorious, and faithful to all
men, and that he may see true Dreams_. And
if any one will engrave upon the Stone _Gnanthius_
the Bird _Glaux_, and under its Feet the
Fish, and under these enclose the Eyes, and
wear it, abstaining from Swines Flesh and
from all uncleanness, when it is dark he
shall appear an elegant Man; therefore those
that see him, shall think him Divine. In the
day time also whatsoever he sayes, he shall
be believed in it. And has in bed it will
shew true Visions.



## LETTER IV. Δ.

_Draconthea, the Herb Dragons. [Δενδροκολάπτης](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B4%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B4%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%BB%CE%AC%CF%80%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82),
the Bird Woodpecker. Draco, a Fish. Dendritis, a Tree stone_.

_Draconthea_ is an Herb, having Seed like
the eyes of a Dragon, broad leaves, is bad
altogether. The _Woodpecker_ is a Bird known
to all, as big as a Quail, it perforates Oaks,
Olive trees and Nut trees, that it may make
a Nest in the middle of the Wood. The
_Dragon_ is a Sea fish without scales: After
therefore that it has voided much, and would
do over great violence, the Clouds of Heaven
snatch it into the Air, and dash it against
the Mountains, tearing it Limb from
Limb, so that is it no more. _That one be not
hurt_; It is two forked, like a Horses Tail,
two fingers in length. Putting it in Oyl,
keep it. Putting it in Oyl indeed, it preserves
all People from fascination and infirmity.
For I saw this upon the Sea coasts of
the _Assyrian_ Countrey. _Dendrites_ is a Stone,
which is known by many; This grows in
_India_ in Rocky maritime places about six
fingers high. _For Hearing_; The Seed of the
Herb _Draconthea_ worn sharpens the Sight,
and removes a little pain in the Head. The
Feather also of the Bird, with a little of the
Stone _Dendrites_, cures the _Hemicrania_
or half Head-ach. In like manner the
Feather of the Bird, and a little of the Fish
bruised and applied, suddenly cures every
Head-ach. Let us not therefore mistake for
the difficult finding of the great _Draconthea_,
but those things which are done, are from
the little _Draconthea_, which is two hand-breadths
high, and it is as the Fish or the
Serpent, and we put this for the other. _For
a [λευκοφλεγματία](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%B5%CF%85%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%86%CE%BB%CE%B5%CE%B3%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%B1), or a Flesh Dropsie, and an
έλεφαντία, or Leprosie of the_ Arabians, _and
any Leprosie_. For a pain in the Head, and
the beginning of an _Elephantia_ and _Leprosie_,
and any breaking out of the Skin, the Fat
of the Dragon-Fish with the Juice of the
Herb, anoynt morning and evening. _To open
Doors, Locks, Dolts, and to tame wild Beasts,
and to be beloved of all, and to acquire all
things, that whatever you please may be done
for you_. And if one obtain the hole of
Tree, in which the young ones of the Woodpecker
are, he shall carry the Herb which
knows, and touching it opens: For if it be
made of Clay or Chalk, the dirt will fall:
If of Stone it bursts: If a wooden Board or
iron Plate be so fastned with Nails, all things
cleave and break in pieces upon the touch
of the Herb, and the Woodpecker opens and
takes out her young ones. If any one therefore
have got this Herb, he will do many
things, which are not now lawful to mention,
as of the mod Divine Nature, which Man
cannot perform. If therefore any man engrave
a Woodpecker in the Stone _Dendrites_,
and a Sea-Dragon under its feet, and enclose
the Herb underneath it, which the Woodpecker
found and carried, every Gate will
open to him, and Bolts and Locks. Salvage
Beasts will also obey him, and come to tameness;
he shall also be beloved and observed
of all, and whatsoever he hath a
mind to, he shall acquire and perform. _Mercury_
was a most accursed Pagan, and was
worshipped as a God: but I worship _Christ_,
and do unwillingly write of _Mercury_. _O the
Blessedness of the Gods!_ _Mercury_ is an Animal
unknown to GOD, and also his Nature.
For who can find out the generation of Men?
He is not, yea, a deceiver, Thou art wise,
and instructing hast given understanding in
the Pillar, _Thus far Nature_. But he that
carries it, shall learn those things that are in
the Gods, shall open Locks, and loose Chains,
shall pacifie all wild Beasts by the will which
is in Heaven, shall asswage the waves of the
terrible Sea, shall chase away all Devils,
and shall appear good to all men. But we
will alter for the purpose. If perchance you
should not find the Herb, which opens the
shut Nest of the Woodpecker, enclose under
the engraven Stone the top of a Feather of
the Birds wings and the Heart, and one feed
of the Herb _Draconthea_, and the Stone or
the Brain of the Fish. For being so carried,
they give sharp-sightedness to the Eyes,
cure the Head-ach, and expel all Diseases of
the Eyes and Head from the Bearer. Moreover
they represent him rich and potent to
all Men.



## LETTER V. E.

_[Εὔζωμον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B5%E1%BD%94%CE%B6%CF%89%CE%BC%CE%BF%CE%BD), the Herb Rocket. Enlui, aëdon,
a Nightingale. [Έχῖνος](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CF%87%E1%BF%96%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82), a Sea-Urchin. Enanthus,
a Stone._

_Euzomon_ is the herb Rocket, which is eaten
among pot-herbs, and known to all men.
_Echinus_, the Sea-Urchin is also known to all.
_Enlui_ is a Nightingale, known well enough.
_Enanthus_ is a Stone of every colour, and it
is dedicated to _Venus_, because it is of many
colours. Rocket therefore heats, because
here(?) is an Error among many, and they,
know not the nature of every Herb. Against
Lust and Erection. Therefore Priests eat Rue,
and the herb _Agnus castus_, for Chastity's sake,
For green Rocket quenches Lust much, and
frequent Erection, and Dreams. Wherefore
Priests, when by their turns they serve in the
Temples, do often eat this, and they fall not
into pollution. _For Erection_, of the Seed of
this ℥iv. Pepper ℥i. with Honey morning
and night take as much as you can take up
with two fingers. But if a man be grown old,
and have a loose and hanging Member, he
shall do this. Of Seed of Rocket ℥xvj. Cumin
℥viij, Pepper ℥iv. of Seed of Purslain ℥ij.
Being bruised and made up with Honey, let
him take it morning and evening. It is incomparable.
And the eyes and the heart of a
Nightingale laid about men in Bed, keep them
awake. _To make one die for sleep_. For if any
one dissolve them, and give them secretly to
any in drink, he will never sleep, but will so
die, and it admits not of Cure. _For Epileptick
Persons_. If you give half the Navil of
a Sea-Urchin dissolved, to such as are held
of an Epilepsie, they will presently be relieved;
but give it only with Honey frequently.
_That you may be amiable to men, and
known for eloquence, and acceptable, and that
you may be feared of Men and wild Beasts_.
In the Stone _Enanthus_ with Gold engrave
_Venus_, and let her Locks and the Hair of her
Head be tied to her Head, and put the root
of the Herb, and the Nightingale's Tongue
under her, enclose it and wear it, and you
will be amiable to all men, and known, and
eloquent; and not only to Men, but Devils
and wild Beasts will fly from you.


## LETTER VI. Z.
_Ζμίλαξ, the Herb Bindweed. Zaukos, a Bird.
Zmirena, a Sea-fish. Smaragdus, an Emerauld._

_Smilax_ is a very strong Herb, like the Plant
Ivy. _For Women's Travail_. If you Crown a
Woman with it, that has hard Travail, she
will presently bring forth without pain. _For
Prægnation_. If any Woman suffer difficulty
with pain in prægnation, gird her with it,
and she will breed without pain. And if
you mix of the Juyce of the Leaves ℥j. and
of Honey another ℥. and give it an Hydropick
person, the party will purge without
danger: But a Woman, if she drinks it,
will suffer a Flux of Blood. _Zaucos_ or _Zeucos_,
a sort of Bird, some call it a _Harpe_. For
it is a Vultur devouring white Carkases.
_Zmirena_, a Sea-Lamprey, is known to all.
An Emerauld is a known Stone. Therefore
if you give the Gut of an _Harpe_ to any one
to eat, the Eater will be torn; for he will be
insatiable. And if you give the great Gut
of it, which is called _κωλέντερον_ or _Colon_, powdered
in drink to any one, or roasted to eat,
it will perfectly cure the Colick. _For People
troubled with the Quartane Ague and the Leprosie_.
And its Fat applied with an Oyntment of
Oyl expels a Quartane. The Dung also applied
with Vinegar stops Leprosie. And whatever
you will of the Liver given inwardly,
corrupts all things that are within. _For all
disturbance of Dreams, and Lunaticks, and those
that are troubled with the Colick_. The Emerauld
is a green precious Stone. Engrave
therefore upon it the Bird _Harpe_, and under
its feet a Sea-Lamprey, and under the Stone
enclose the Root of the Herb, and wear it,
against Disturbance, and Dreams, and Stupidity.
It causes Rest to Lunaticks, and to
them that are troubled with the Colick. And
it is better, if the Fat of the Sea-Lamprey be
put underneath: For this is Divine.


## LETTER VII. H.
_Ἠρύγγιος, the Herb we call Eryngo. [Ηλιακή](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%A1%CE%BB%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%82),
the Sun-Bird, or [Φοινικόπτερα](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%86%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CF%8C%CF%80%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%82), i.e having scarlet
Wings.[ Ἥφαιστος](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%AD%CF%86%CE%B1%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82), S. emagines, Vulcane's Stone.
[Ηδονή](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%A1%CE%B4%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%AE), the Fish Delight, some call it Affidion, a
kind of Anchovy._

_Eryngo_ is an Herb like _Calamus_; it grows
thorny; its Vertues are such as these: For,
if any carry its Root, he shall not at any
time suffer the Treachery of Devils. _That
the Devil may confess who he is, and from whence?
And to cast him out_: And if any one have
an aëreal Spirit, put one of these Roots under
his Cloaths, and he will confess to you
who he is, and will fly from the Man, a stranger
to him. And the whole Herb drunk
with its Root in Water and Honey asswages
the Colick. _For the Stone-Colick and the Stone,
and the Strangury_: And if it be made hot,
and drunk with Water and Honey, it cures
those those that are troubled with the Stone,
and the Stone-colick, and the Strangury.
And let them drink it for sixteen days, every
Morning, in Bed: But if you heat _φλοιώδες ροάς_ (?)
(which is Pomgranate-Rind) with it, it will
do more good. _Hedone_ is a Sea-fish, which
is called _Aphydion_, being often eaten, it cures
the bloody Flux, and Pains in the Kidneys.
And in _Hephastion_'s, i.e. _Vulcane_'s Stone, which
is called _Pyrites_, or the Fire-stone, if any one
engrave a _Phœnicopterus_, and at its Feet a
Scorpion, and put under the Stone the Root
of the Herb, he will have a Phylactery, and
a Guard, or a Treacle against poysonous
Stings; it also drives away nocturnal Phantasms,
and all Witchcraft, and is good also
for those that are troubled with the Stone.
Being worn, it confers the Grace and Vertue
of Prudence. _Saturnius_ himself wore it, and
_Phaos_ in Heaven; and in Earth it possesses
Gold and Silver; it destroys Infirmity, and
cruel Poverty, and the evil Bonds of Necessity,
that which gives Trouble is not good,
but forces every Earth, beating Men with
the Degree of Fortune, binding them in Necessities.
A certain Saturnine King _Kiranis_
_Κυλινδράτης_, turning and rolling circular upon
the Centre, with uncorrupt, and never-failing
Changes, whirling all things from the
_East_ to the _West_, in the seven Arctick, i.e.
_North_, Stars, holding and moving all strange
things. Soul, be thou content and sufficient
in those things which thou actest in failing
Time! and tho' thou be after Prægnation,
yet presently thou knowest GOD in the
Air, and in the Clouds; thou sufferest Infirmity
upon the Earth, in which being an
Inhabitant, thou art tormented. O blessed
Soul! being thenceforth immortal, cease from
corporeal Labours; tho' in these thou be fixt
to the Body, yet seek Heavenly things, or
from whence Water is? If thou wilt learn, I will
declare to thee all things which thou bidst
me. Heaven is Water and Fire, the Stars
are visible, and unspeakable Darkness is above
the Gods. And a Sphere rolling from
_East_ to _West_. And that which moves all things
in the Sphære with wakeful Winds, sets in the
Sea. It brings Lightning, and dissolves the
Air, it strikes with Thunder, and flashes out
flaming Fire; it gives sweet Rain, and gives
all Meat good for the Belly. And the Divine
Virtue, which does this, itself hides all things
that are Earth-born, Roots of Herbs, which
are abroad among divers Generations of Men;
and they are given for all four-footed Beasts,
creeping things, and Fowls of the Air, which
spontaneously do all things in their Nests
and Dens for Man, all well coloured and
green. Let what I said before suffice thee;
I tell thee in Prose, and show unto thee all
the Divinations of the Soul concerning all
Virtues; I will tell thee more, when they are
revealed. For I have told future things in
Metre, or Verse, concerning the fore-knowledge
of other Animals. _For the præscience of
those things that are in Heaven and in Earth,
and what any one has in his Soul; and whatever
things are done in Climates and Cities, and
all future things to Men_. There is an Animal
flying in the Air, which is called [_ἔποψ_](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%94%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%88), _upupa_,
or Houp, of seven Colours, having a Crest on
his Head, the height of two Fingers, which
extends and contracts. And it is of four Colours,
that it may be directed to the four
Seasons of the Year. This Bird is called _Cucubas_,
as it is written concerning the same, in
a former Book, that is called _Archaicus_. And
this Animal is sacred. Take therefore this
Bird, and tear it in pieces, and while it is
panting, swallow its Heart, turning to the
Sun, in the beginning of the first, or eighth
Hour, on _Saturday_, the Moon being Oriental,
and drink upon it Milk of a Black Cow,
with a little Honey in the Drink. See that
you swallow the Heart sound and entire,
and you will foreknow what things will be
in Heaven, and what on Earth, and whatever
any one has in his Soul, or whatever
is done in Climates, and in Cities, and what
will come to all Men. And this will be the
Composition of the Honey; Of Honey ℔j,
℥β. living Magnet powdered ℥ij. and tender
Stalks of the Herb Eryngo ℥vij. When these
are bruised, make them up with the Honey,
And you may have another Magnet, wherein
a _Cucubas_, i.e. an Houp is engraven, all which
you must dip in the Composition of the Honey.
And when you would foreknow any
thing, first taste it with the Finger, and put
the engraven Load-stone about your Neck,
and you shall foreknow whatever you please,
And if you put another Liver and Heart of
a _Cucusa_ into the Confection, it will be better,
because it will make you of a stronger
Memory. And that the Heart may not be
corrupted in him that eats it, by six-footed
Creatures, because he that eats this Honey,
and swallows this Heart, uses to breed
many Lice; it is necessary, that he be anointed
first with this Oyl. Take of Oyl ℥vijβ.
of Staves-acre bruised ℥ij. beat them well up
into one, put it up, and keep it in readiness.
And when there is occasion for it, then anoint
your self in Bed. _If therefore thou foreknowest,
foretel to me, whether the Soul be mortal, or
immortal?_ He answering, saith, _Hear, my Son!
Very many false Sophisters are mistaken in the
Understanding of the immortal Soul, but it discerns
it self Why is it, that the Body is at rest
in Bed, and the Soul is conversant in its proper
place, i.e. in the Air, whence also we took
this Soul, and sees what things are done in other
Climates? Many times also there is a sympathy,
as between the Mother and the Child, and
it is solicitous for the Body in which it inhabits,
and before the time foresees and divines future
things, whether they be good or evil, which is
called a Dream. Then it returns to the Body, and its
proper Habitation, and rising it searches out. Hence
it may appear to thee, that the Soul is immortal
and incorporeal._ Thus says _Harpocration_, finishing
this Letter in this place. But _Kiranis_ in
some things sayes other wise; and in other
things agreeing, he sayes concerning the eating
of the _Houp_, that from it there is Præscience
of all worldly things. Then he said
this; Because the Head and Heart and the utmost Root
of Eryngo is hard to be found;
if you will find it without difficulty, you
must do thus: Take the Seed of Eryngo and
the Earth on which it grows, and put the
Earth and Seed into a Potter's or wooden
Vessel, and sprinkle it sometimes with water,
and when the Herb is sprung up, and is come
to maturity, like other Ervngoes, then seek,
it, as it becomes you, fasting and chast, and
you will find the _Gorgon_'s head. Keep this,
and have it in readiness. Take therefore
the Hairs of a _Phoca_, the Seal, which are between
his Nose and his Mouth, and the
green Jasper Stone, and the Heart and Liver
of the Houp, and the Roots of the _Gorgon_
of Eryngo, and the feed of [_περιστερεών_](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%8E%CE%BD)
i.e. upright Vervein, and the clean Blood of
_Chrysanthemum_, i.e. the Juice of the Herb _Plumaria_
or _Strechas_, and the extremity of the
heart of the Seal, and moreover the Crest of
a Houp's head also; it were better if you
had of all the foresaid sorts. Which you
must wrap up with a little Moss with _Thymiana_
of four sorts, and put it in the skin of
an _Ichneumon_, or Seal, or Stag, or Crow, or
Vultur, and wear it chastly. And if you guild
the outside, it will be better, for you will acquire
whatever you have a mind to, you will
be beloved of Men and Women, and you
will appear reverend, and peaceful, and quiet:
you will tame wild Beasts, and conquer
your Enemies. And if you put the right
eye of a Wolf into the foresaid things, you
will overcome all wild Beasts, and you will
acquire by all things. Devils and wild Beasts
will fly you, and you will be most happy,
and healthful, and altogether unhurt. For I
mixt also the Rennet of a Sea-Calf, I overcame
all my Enemies, and I was invincible.
For he that carries this Phylactery, shall have
Gifts from GOD, which he hoped not for,
and he shall be honoured on every hand, conquering
all men in Word and Work, deliveing [sic]
from all danger, and from the Devil, and
from Witchcraft, and from all Evil. I will
say further: _It averts all evil, and confers all
good_. This also is a Prognostick, which only
GOD and you must know. _This Letter of_
Kirani _is perfect_.



## LETTER VIII. Θ.

_[θύρσος](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B8%CF%8D%CF%81%CF%83%CE%BF%CF%82), Herba Dionysi, Ivy. Thyr, a Bird. Thyrsites a Stone. [θύννος](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%B8%CF%8D%CE%BD%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%82) a Fish_.

_Thyrsites_ or _Thyrsus_ the Herb of _Bacchus_,
fruitful and profitable for all things. _Thyr_
is a Bird like the Hawk of the Sea, having a
divine Efficacy. _Thyrsite_ is a Stone like to
Coral. _Thynnus_, a Tuny, is a Sea-fish, and
is eaten, like to a Whiting, which being
great is known indeed. _Balkera_ is _Bacchus_
his Plant. In the Feasts of _Bacchus_ they put
the _Thyrsus_ upon the Wine-presses, the plant of
the earth is given to Men for chearfulness, the
Virtues whereof I now will tell. It is good
in Wine to pour out in the Presses, what
Mortals forever have it given them: I will also
say this in Verse, To see or know is of the
Earth. _For Joy and Mirth in Drink_. If
you bruise ℥ij of this Plant, and of the
Stone, and shall say over it the Name of
Bacchus, shall put it into a Flagon of Wine,
out of which they all drink Wine, having
drunk but one Glass they will all be mellow,
as if they were drunk, and returning thanks
they will say; Thou haft mad e us merry, O
Lord! _Here Friends may drink, and go away
merry and rejoycing_; If you put the right
eye of a _Thynnus_ (or Tuny) or of an _Athynnus_
in Wine, the Friends that are sate
down will break into Joy without drinking,
and they will thank you, as if they were
merry. _For Discord at Feast_; And if you
cut the Wing or the top of a Feather of the
Bird _Thyr_ with a Sword that is all Iron, and
put it into a Vessel of Wine, saying over it
the Name of _Bacchus_, and when you have a
mind, make them that are sate down spill it,
that they may shed blood and beat one another,
and it will be so. _That you may be
without Drunkenness, and for all favour and
health_; In the Stone _Thyrsites_ engrave the
Bird _Thyr_ and _Bacchus_ holding the Bird, and
under the Stone enclose the Root of the Herb,
and wear it, and you will be without Drunkenness,
and will have Favour with all men,
and moreover you will be without danger
and invincible in the Palace. For this is a
divine Dionysiack, and weakens the strength
of _Bacchus_. For so sayes _Harpocration_.



## LETTER IX. I.

_Ιτία, i.e. a Willow, a fruitless Tree. Jaspis,
A Jasper Stone, green. [Ικτίν](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%B0%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%AF%CE%BD), a Kite, a Bird.
[Ἰούλίς](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%B0%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BB%CE%AF%CF%82), a Fish._

The Willow is a barren Tree. The Jasper
is a known Stone. The Kite is a Bird known
to all men. The _Iülis_ is a party-coloured
Sea-fish, which is easily found. Bruise, I say,
the green Leaves of Willow with a little Salt,
and apply it to the aking Spleen, and the
pain will presently cease. And if you would
have the Spleen dissolved, boyl the Bark with
_Oxymel_, and give two spoonfuls tasting, or
thus: Make it to boyl to a third, and give
to every one according to his own strength.
And in a Jasper engrave a Kite tearing a Serpent,
and under the Stone put a Stone taken
out of the head of a Kite, and enclose it, give
it to wear in the Breast, for it will drive away
all pain of the Stomach, and will create
an Appetite to eat, and good Digestion. For
it has also other Virtues, let it be worn only
in the Breast.



## LETTER X. K.

_Κυναίδιος, Kynædius, an Herb, a Stone, a
Bird, and a Fish so called._

_Kynædius_ is an Herb, which is also [περιστερεών](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%80%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B5%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%8E%CE%BD)
_Meretricis_, Whores Vervein; _centum capita_
[Άφροδίτης](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%86%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7), the hundred heads of _Venus_. _Kynædius_
is a Bird, which is called _Iynx_, as
_Kiranus_ says in the Verse of Theocritus; for
Example's sake:

[῏Ιυγξ, ἕλκε τὺ τῆνον ἐμὸν ποτὶ δῶμα τὸν ἄνδρα.](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0228%3Atext%3DId.%3Apoem%3D2)
Per te, Iynx, meus ille domum vir quæso
trahatur!
_Pray_ Iynx! _Fetch my Husband home again!_

Some call it _Jugius Ales_. _Kynædius_ is a Fowl,
and feeds like a Quail turning back its neck,
as _Harpocration_ sayes. This has three Stones
about its neck, it has a long tongue, and is
often dedicated to _Venus_. _Kynædius_ a Sea-fish,
is about fix fingers in greatness, it has a
broad head like an _Uletinus_. It is a round
Fish, of a translucid Body, so that its Backbone
appears through its Body, as through
a Glass; and it abounds in the Sea of _Syria_
and _Palestine_, and of _Syria_ of _Lybia_. This
therefore has two Stones, which also have
their proper actions, as we shall mention
hereafter. And they are in the head. And it
has also another Stone in the third Joynt of
the back towards the Tail, which is most
powerful, and is requisite in the Spell or Ligature
of [Ἀφροδίτη](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%88%CF%86%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%B4%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7), i.e. _Venus_. The Stone
_Kynædius_ was unknown, because it is exceeding
scarce, and is called _Opisianus_ (όψίμοι)
i.e. late or slow. For it is Saturnine. This
Stone is double or twofold: One is obscure
and black; the other is black indeed, but
bright and shining like Glass. This is that
which many seek, and do not know it: for
it is the Dragon's stone. If therefore with a
little of the Herb and Vulture's dung you
make a Fume under a Peach-Tree, the Leaves
will fall. _That a man's Member cannot be
erect, till what is laid be removed_. And if one
lay the Herb under the Pillow, he that lies
upon it shall not erect, and if you give a little
of the Herb powdered in drink to a
Man, he will not erect to coition for seven
dayes. _That a Cock may not tread an Hen_;
Give it to a Cock in Bran or Paste, and he
will not tread a Hen. _That a man for one
day may be Κύναιδοι,_ i.e. _a Fornicator_; That
which is in the Fish _Kynædius_, in the third
Joynt of the backbone, if you give it in
meat or drink, a man will be a manifest Fornicator
for one day. _To make a Cock tread a
Cock_; If you give it to a Cock with Paste,
he will get upon other Cocks, and upon any
Male Animal. If therefore any thing take
this Stone, it will get upon the like animal,
as upon a Female. And the aforesaid stone
does all these things. _To obtain favour and
friendship_; If anyone carry the Tongue of
the Bird in a Plate of Gold, he shall have
Favour, and be beloved of all. _To make
Men soft_; if the ends of the wings, of the
Flesh (I mean) not of the Feathers, be
secretly given to a Man, or to any Male Animal,
he will become soft, and do female
works. _For Favour_; And if any one carry
the right eye under an immaculate Saphire
stone, whereon _Venus_ is engraven, he
will be gracious and acceptable to all, and
will overcome in every Consistory. And the
left eye carried by a Woman, will do the
same. _To make the Eyes bloodshot_; The Blood put
in a plate for a _Collyrium_, and found, makes the
eyes bloodshot. _For a Tertian and a Quartan
Ague_; And the Heart tied about one, when
the Moon is in the Wane, cures People of
Tertian and Quartan Agues. _For an incurable
Head-ach_; And the Brain of the Bird given
secretly in Drink or Meat, eases an incurable
Head-ach. _For Hepatick Persons_; And
its Liver boyled with Salt and Water cures
Hepatick Persons. _Of Goddess_ Venus _her Girdle_;
The kind of _Venus_. The first and strong
_Cestus_, i.e. Girdle, mollifies the hearts
of Men, and of all Animals, and the Natures
of the Males especially, so that the touching
or carrying of this makes them soft and effeminate.
Further also; Upon the Stone _Opfarius_
engrave a Man having his Privities cut
off, placed or lying at his Feet, and his hands
contracted underneath; and himself reaching
down to his Privities, and behind his back
let there be Venus, having back to back, she
turning her self, and seeing him. Enclose
therefore the Stone of the Fish _Cynædius_. But
if you have not one of them which are under
the head, you must put underneath the
Root of the Herb, and the end of the Bird's
left wing. Enclose it in a large Gold Box,
and you must put it into a thong of the nerve
of a Hawk's Stomach, let it be thin, sewing
it in the middle of the thong or nerve, that
it do not appear. This is that which is painted
in the head of _Venus_, comprehended in
a thong or ligature, which is called _Cestus_.
_That a male may not erect_; If any one touch
a Male with the thong or ligature, he will
not erect, and if he carries it unknowingly,
he grows effeminate. And if he carry any of
the Stone of the Fish, he will be altogether
luxurious, not returning to his Nature. And
if a Woman carry this ligature, none will carnally
lie with her. For the Man cannot erect.
And the measure of the ligature in respect of
breadth, must be two fingers; of length, five
palms. _Another Preparation of Venus_; There
is also another Vessel or Preparation of _Venus_,
which the Queens of Venus carry in pure
Gold, and whoever else are able. These also
must be in a ligature, which is made of a
nerve in such a manner, as that the stones
appear not, having a Sculpture, as is subjoyned.
And the first must be (_Lapis Sulphureus_)
_Lechnitis_ or _Kerannitis_ in the middle of the
thong or ligature, having _Mars_ armed engraven.
In this let there be Diamond stones
sewed, having _Venus_ with a thorn about her
feet. And again on the other side two immaculate
winged Creatures, having _Venus_ tied
by her hair to Love standing by. Again also
other two stones on each side, and in like
manner a _Sardinian_ engraven, having on each
side a Sun drawn with four Colts, that is, a
Coach, and a Moon with two Bulls, each stone
having each: And other two stones on each
side, having _Mercury_ engraven, with the rod
of a Scepter in his right hand: And other
two _Anankite_, i.e. true Unions or white Pearl,
having on each side Erachmites, i.e. reins, the
Goddess _Nemesis_ having her foot upon a
wheel, and holding a Rod. And other two
immaculate Pearls, being on each side not
engraven, and put in the _Cesius_; so that in all
there are thirteen Stones fixt in Golden Cases,
and so sewed in a ligature, that they may
not be seen by the Crowd. And there is a
twofold holy ligature, and it follows: Another
Stone may be carried, hung about the
neck, which is called [Σεληνίτης](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82) i.e. Lunar
Stone, in which the Encrease of the Moon
and its Divinity appears. And let it have a
Moon engraven, and underneath the Stone
the Root of barren _Selinum_, that is,
Parsly, in a Gold Case. And this is worn
about the neck. _For wonderful and magnificent
Acts_; This Mystery worn makes the wearer
divine, and he is in veneration and adored
by all. For many Kings carry it under-hand,
or within their Crown, as a _Cestus_, so that
it may be seen of none. And they say, that
a _Selenites_ worn in a Ring does the same. But
that we may not destroy our Boo , let this
Discourse suffice, for it has great Virtues.
Wherefore, my Son! I have expounded and
written these things with great study and labour.
And know this, that no one else has
it. Wherefore give this Divine Mystery to no man.


## LETTER XI. Λ.

_Λίβανοι, the Frankincense tree. Lyngurius,
a Stone. Lynx, a Vulture. [Λάβραξ](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BB%CE%AC%CE%B2%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%BE), a Fish called
a Bass._

Libanus is a shrubby tree, whole Gum
fumigated raises divine Spirits. _Lingurius_ is a
stone about the Hills _Lingui_, thence so
called. But some say it is the Gum of the
Poplar tree; however it is good. _Lynx_ is a
Bird, which is called Gyps or a Vulture, a
very strong Creature. _Labrax_ is a Sea-fish
called a _Bass_, known to all. _Of these a soft
Eye-Salve is made for all dimness of the Eyes,
so that in three days it makes the Sight sharp. It
is good for the beginning of a Suffusion, a Cataract,
turning back of the Eye-lid, Roughness,
dilatation of the Pupilla, Owl-fightedness, Watriness,
itchng [sic], Driness, falling away of the
hairs of the Eye-lids, eating away of the Corners
of the Eyes, and for many other Diseases. Anointing
with it is excellent good for all these things._ And
this is the Confection of it: Of _Olibannum_ ℥iv.
_Lapis Lyngurius_ ℥ii. Vultures Gall ℥vi. liver
of a Bass ℥iij. the best Honey ℥vj. When
this is old, it is better. But _Kirani's_ Eye Salve
was thus;  Of _Olibanum_ ℥vj. Gall of a
_Bass_, Gall of a Vultur, each ℥vj. Pepper ℥iij.
Honey without dross ℥iij. In the Stone
_Lyngurius_ engrave a Vulture, and put underneath
a little Frankincense, and the top of
the Bird's Wings, and carry it: for it will be
good for the Pin and Web in the Eyes.



## LETTER XII. M.

_[Μορέα](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BC%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%AD%CE%B1), a Mulberry tree. Migrios, a Bird,
Mydicus, a Stone. Mormyros, a Fish known
to all._

The _Mulberry tree_ is known to all. _Migrios_
the Bird, is a Night-Raven, known to all.
_Mydicus_, the Stone, is dedicated to _Venus_. _Mormyros_
is a little edible Sea-fish, like a Bass.
_To make a Diarrhea and Evacuation_; The
Juice of the Root of the Mulberry-tree given
secretly in meat or drink, purges, and
causes a _Diarrhea_. And if any one chew
the inner Rind of the Root, and swallow his
Spittle, and spit out the Substance, that man
will die of a _Diarrhea_. _It is good for great
pain in the Teeth called Grinders, and in the
Gums, and does not suffer them to corrode, yea,
it makes them that are corroded, fill without
pain_. Of the inner Rind ℥ij. of sharp Vinegar
℥xix. Bruise or shred the Rind, boyl it
half away; wash the Mouth with it morning
and evening. _For Womens Flux of Blood from
the Matrix or from the Arse_; And we have
discoursed this by the divine power. Some
therefore of the boughs of the Mulberry tree
are upright, others look down to the ground,
and they have large Buds like an Egg. If any
man then shall stand upright on his feet,
and shall look towards the South-west wind,
and with two fingers of his left hand shall
raise the bud of the twig of a Branch that
looks upward, extending and pulling it towards
the East. and shall wrap it up in true
Purple or Red, and tie it about, and shall
touch a Woman that is troubled with a flux
of Blood from the Matrix or Arse, the Flux
will stop in three days. _For such as spit
Blood_; But if a man pluck a Bud that looks
downward, as before was said, _i.e._ standing,
and shall tie it up, he will stop spitting of
Blood in three dayes. These are the things
they call Anacardia; those indeed that look
upwards cure inferior Fluxes in so many
dayes, and those that look downward, cure
the superior. And this is that for the Flux
of Blood, which they call άνακαρδία, or κατωκαρδία.
_For the Enteridæ, which are called
Exophanæ_, or [έξοχάδες](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CE%BE%CE%BF%CF%87%CE%AC%CE%B4%CE%B5%CF%82), _i.e._ the Hæmorrhoids.
Indeed many false Sophisters are mistaken.
But for the _Enteridæ_, which are called _Hæmorrhoides_ and Exochades, a Medicine is made.
It is of the unripe Juice of the Mulberry ℥ij.
_Chalcitis_ ℥xij. _Lapis Indicus_ ℥iv. The ends of
seven Crows wings with a little Wine, mix it
with a Feather of the fame wings, till it is
soft and tough like Glew. For the inner
_Hæmorrhoids_ make Suppositories or Clysters,
and for the _Exochades_ or outer, make inunctions.
And in the Name of GOD use this
Ligature. In a little Stone engrave the Fish
_Mormyrus_, and enclose it in an Iron Box, and
put under it a Bud of Mulberry-tree looking
upward, and carry it. _It will be good for
Hæmorrhoids and in the Arse. For spitting of
Blood, and Bleeding at the Nose, and any Diseases
above_; A Purge also is prepared of the
Root of the Mulberry-tree. O Mulberry-tree!
a potent Plant, not created for a few things!
For thy Juice mixt equally with the Juice
of the root of the Herb _Stratiotes_ of _Persia_,
_i.e._ Savory, and in like manner the Juice of
Tithymal and Scammony equally, mix them
all equally, and boyl thrice as much Honey,
to the thickness of an Oyntment, and when
you have taken it off, put it up in a Glass
Bottle, and give of it one fasting and that
keeps an exact Diet. But if you give above
the bigness of a Bean, he that takes it will
be seized with a Vomiting and Looseness, and
will not live a day. Give nothing superfluous
in Meat or Drink, but give to every one
according to the strength of the Taker.

Νεκυία is the herb _Florinus_, i.e. _Tapsus
Barbatus_ or _Mullein_: There are seven sorts of
this Herb. It differs therefore as much as the
Leaves, which ascend a cubit above the Earth,
They burn the Leaves of this in Lamps for
Wieks. For they have them in Νεκυϊηαις
μαντέιαις (_i.e._ in Necromancy) which is performed
in a Shell, which they do to this
day. Wherefore they call this herb _Nekya_.
_For [νέκυς](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BD%CE%AD%CE%BA%CF%85%CF%82)_ signifies _dead_. Νῆττα, i.e. a Duck,
is a bird swimming in Rivers, about the bigness
of a Hen. [Ναυκράτης](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BD%CE%B1%CF%85%CE%BA%CF%81%CE%AC%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82) is the Sea-fish
[ἐχενηΐς](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CF%87%CE%B5%CE%BD%CE%B7%CE%90%CF%82),
or _Remora, i.e._ Stop-ship; if this stick to a
Ship under Sail, it will not suffer the Ship to
stir, it would break first, or a Tree might
sooner be pluckt up by the roots. _For the
Gout_; This whole Fish boyled in Oyl, to
the thickness of Wax, then the Oyl strained
out, and boiled to the thickness of a Plaster,
this applied Plasterwise cures the Gout. _Nemesites_
is a Stone from the Altar of _Nemesia_,
a Goddess of the _Athenians_, It is an excellent
stone. Let _Nemesis_ therefore be engraven
on that stone, having one of her
Feet upon a Wheel. Her Favour is like a
Virgin's, holding in her left hand a _Pirrhis_,
_i.e._ an Elne or Measure, and in her right hand
a Rod, and with one foot treading upon an
Oxe. And enclose under it the stone _Acronius_,
and a little of the Mulberry-tree. _If therefore
you shew that Finger to one possessed, the
Devil will immediately confess himself and be
gone. It is good also for Phantasms, and Dreams
of Devils, and for Childrens Frights, and
Nightly Fears._ But the Wearer must abstain
from all polluted and unclean things. _For this
Ring king worn, shews the quantity of the years of
life, and the quality of death, and the place._ If you
sew a little of the bones of the short Fish
_Remora_ in a Horses Hide, and have it with
you when you take shipping, _the Ship will
not budge in the water at hoisting Sail,_ unless
what is put there be taken away, or you go
out of the Ship. _For the, fore-knowledge of
Life and Death-; as I said before, you must
use the prægustation, or præcognition of the
Hawk._



## LETTER XIV. Ξ.

_[Ξιφίον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BE%CE%AF%CF%86%CE%B9%CE%BF%CE%BD), an Herb. Xiphius, a Stone. Xiphius,
a Bird. [Ξιφίας](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CE%BE%CE%B9%CF%86%CE%AF%CE%B1%CF%82), a Fish known to all,
called_ Spatha _or_ Gladius.

_Xiphion_, i.e. _Gladiole_, is an herb, which
abounds in all Lands; it has Leaves like
Corn, but longer. It grows in plowed
grounds with Corn, some call it _Machera_,
_i.e._ a Knife or Skien, others [φάσγανον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%86%CE%AC%CF%83%CE%B3%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%BF%CE%BD), a
Sword. It ascends upright from the ground
as one Arm; and it is but of one Branch. It
Has a Gold coloured, purplish, sweet-sented
Flower. Shepherds make Garlands of it in
the Spring time. _Xiphias_ a kind of Sapphire,
a stone known to all, this is as plentiful as
Pebbles in every Land, it is of colour like
to _Calenos_. in the Region of Syria they use this
at the burnt Sacrifice of four-footed Beasts.
_Xiphius_, the Bird, is a kind of Hawk, which
is called _Kydos_. _Xiphias_ the Fish is party-coloured,
little and small like the _Iülis_. The
Flower therefore and Root of the Herb if a
quantity be kept in a Jar or Hogshead of Oyl,
and continue there for some time, when you
take it out and put it up again, it will be
the Unguent, that is required in the Sacred
Books, which in the Country of _Melanitis_ is
called _Sustnum_. About which the old Prophets
are mistaken. But in the Country of
_Syria_ the Plant is called _Susannum_, and in
_Melanitis Susinum_. This Herb has two roots,
one above and another below. _If therefore
you give the upper Root to any one mixt in Wine,
to drink, he will erect: But es any one drink.the
tower, it will do the contrary, and he will be
without seed. In the Stone therefore engrave
a Hawk , and under its feet a Fish, and enclose
the Root of the Herb under the Stone,
and keep it. This Ring is chast, and so is
he that wears it. If therefore you have it
about you, in the Oracle you will see, what
you have a mind to. And if you put it upon
any Animal, or upon any framed Idol, it
will give you an Oracle concerning all that,
which you have a mind to know. And the
Head of the Fish put into a suffumigation
with Myrrh, makes them that smell it seem
as if they were possessed with the Devil. But
do you anoynt your Nose with strong Oyntment,
and you will no way be enraged or
mad._



## LETTER XV. O.

_Όνοθύρπς, an Herb. [Όρτυξ](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BD%84%CF%81%CF%84%CF%85%CE%BE), a Bird. Orphos
a Fish. [Όνυχίτης](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BD%80%CE%BD%CF%85%CF%87%CE%AF%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82), a Stone known to all._

_Onothyris_ or _Onothyrsis_ is an Herb, some
call it Όνυμαλάχη _i.e._ Asses Mallow, this is a
Rose, of which they make Garlands; It has
Leaves like domestick Mallow. This by the
Greeks is called [ἀλθαία](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CE%BB%CE%B8%CE%B1%CE%AF%CE%B1) i.e. _Malvaviscus_
Marsh-Mallow. _Ortyx_, a Quail, is a Bird known to all,
yet its Nature is not easily known; for there
is one thing concerning this, unknown. _For
when there are great Storms upon the Coasts of_
Lybia deserta, _the Sea casts up great Tunnies
upon the shore, and these breed Worms for fourteen
dayes, and grow to be as big as Flies, then
at Locusts , which being augmented in bigness
become Birds, called Quails. After this the
South or South-west Wind blowing strong, they
pass the Seas into_ Pamphylia _or_ Cilicia _and_ Ireland,
_and consquently, the North-wind blowing,
they go to the Sea-coasts of the Country of_ Syria
_and the other parts of the Land of_ Melanitis.
_But abominable false Sophisters say, they are
chast, whereas they know not the Nature
of them._ _Orphos_ is an edible Sea-fish, much
like a Tench. _Onychites_ is a _Sardonix_ stone
known to all. The Root therefore of the
Herb boyled with Oyl and the Fat of a Quail,
and then a little Wax added, _is good for hardness
of the Matrix, and Swellings, and Ulcers,
and Itchings, and all other Womens Diseases in
the_ Matrix. And it is put into Medicines for
the Kidneys. And it is good for _Cheironia,
i.e._ the King's Evil. The Eyes of a Quail,
with the Root of the Herb hung about one
diminish a Quotidian and Quartan cold Fire
in the wain of the Moon. _For Illusion;_ Dissolve
the Eyes of the Quail or of the Sea
Tench with a little water in a Glass-Vessel
for seven dayes, then add a little Oyl: Put
a little of this in the Candle, or only anoint a
Rag, and light it among the Company, and
they will look upon themselves like Devils or
fire, so that every one will run his way.
In the _Sardonyx_ Stone engrave a Quail, and under
its Feet a Sea-Tenon, and put a little of the
foresaid Confection under the Stone in the
hollow of the Ring. And when you are willing
not to be seen, anoint your Face all over
with the foresaid Confection, and wear the
Ring, and no Man shall see you, if you do
any thing in the House; no, not if you should
take any thing away that is in the House.



## LETTER XVI. Π.

_[Πολύγονον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%80%CE%BF%CE%BB%CF%8D%CE%B3%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%BF%CE%BD), some call it
[χαμαίζηλον](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%87%CE%B1%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%AF%CE%B6%CE%B7%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%82), Knot-grass.
Porphyrius, a pluvial Bird, or Pluver, which abounds
in Rivers. [Πορφύρα](http://lsj.translatum.gr/wiki/%CF%80%CE%BF%CF%81%CF%86%CF%8D%CF%81%CE%B1), a sea shell-fish, the
Purple: some call it Scolecium, like to a Wilk.
Porphyrius, the Porphyry-stone, well known in the
Country of_ Melanitis.

This Root therefore taken up in the Wane
of the Moon, and carried about one, suffers
not the Eyes to be weak. And its Juice prepared,
as we shall set down hereafter, is good
for many Diseases in the Eyes. _For the Eyes of
Men are subject to and tormented with many
Diseases._ And that I may not depart from
what I say, but make good my word: _In the
Eye-lids_ there happen _Itching, Nits, Lice, falling
of the Hair, entangling of the Hair, Baldness,
Grando, Hordeolum, Warts, Purblindness, thickness
of the Eye-lids, here_ are eleven. About
the {G}, _or skin of the Eye-lids, Roughness,
Watriness, Ulcers, Hairiness,_ here are four.
About the Corners, _scabbiness, dryness, Agethinos,
Adustion, {G}, serix, fretting,
eating away,_ here are nine. _About the Ball
of the Eye, Pterygium, Albula, {G}, {G}, {G};
{G}, {G},
uva visus,_ here are nine. About _the Pupil,
or Sight, there are nebula or nubes, hebetatio,
latitudo pupille, effusio, effectio, defectio,
atrophia,_ or _{G}, glaucedo, {G}, geminæ
pupillæ, {G}, metalopa, myops, obscuratio,_ here
are twelve. In _the whole substance of the Eye,
there are {G}, {G}, {G}, combustio,
suffusio, apostema, comestio, ulcus, circumdolor,
psydrakium,_ here are ten. And there are several
sorts of _Rheums, lene, {A}, subitum, calidum,
dulce, frigidum, tepidum, tenue, acre, antiquum
& arenosum, aluminosum,_ here are eleven
Rheums, and in all fifty five Diseases.
And this is the Preparation of the Confection
for all the foresaid Diseases: Juice of the Herb
℥vj. _Licium Indicum_ ℥vj. Myrrh, Saffron, Frankincense,
_Opium_, each ℥vij. black Acacia ℥xij.
Rain-water ℥v. Beat them up together, and
keep it in a Glass Vessel. But it is better to
put in Wine for Water. _This is a most precious
thing for the Rheum, and for all Diseases of
the Eyes, and Dimness; for it stops every Rheum.
Moreover anointing with it in the Bathe, and
washing it off, is a great help for all pains._ _For
the Hemicrania_. And the raw Flesh of the
Purple-fish, applied Plaster-wise to the Forehead
asswages the _Hemicrania_. And in the
Porphyry-stone engrave the Bird, and under
its feet _Kirikium_, or the Purple-fish, and put
under the Stone the end of the Birds Wings,
and enclose it, and wear it _against every Headach,
and every Hemicrania._ And it is also good
for Rheumarick Eyes. In the Wain of the
Moon make the Ring, And the Eye-salve.



## LETTER XVII. P.

_{G}, a Plant. Romphea, the Bird {G},
an Owl with long Ears well known to all.
{G}, a Sea fish, having as it were a Needle in
its Mouth. {G}, a parti coloured stone, a
horned stone of the end of the Rhinoceros Nose.
For it is like a Horn._

If therefore you put a Branch of the Plant
in the House, all Devils will fly away. And
the Juice of the Plant, and the Fruit with
Honey, applied to the Eye, _sharpens the sight_.
And if it be applied alone, _it takes out white
Specks in the Eye._ But boyl it to a. Thickness.
And the Blood of the Owl, if you anoint with
it, and the Juice of the Herb, and Honey, will
sharpen the sight, and take away a suffusion. And
let an Owl be engraven in the Stone, and at
its Feet the Needle-fish, and under the Stone
put the Root of the Herb. _He that carries
this shall put Devils to flight._ And if you lay
it under the Head of any one that knows it
not, he will not sleep. In like manner also, if
you cut off the Head of a living Owl, and tie
it in a black Skin, and apply it to any ones
left Arm, he will not sleep, till it be taken
from him.



## LETTER XVIII. Σ.

_{G}, an Herb. {G}, a Bird,
Struthiogambarum, an Estrich. {G} a Fish,
a Sea-Cow. Saphirus, a Saphire-stone._

_Satyrion_ is an Herb like _Spinosa_, and it starts
up with its whole Stalk from the Ground; it
is two Palms in heighth, full of Seed: It and
the Seed have a watrish pale Colour. The
Estrich is a known Bird. The Sea-Cow is an
edible Fish, well coloured and known. The
immaculate Saphire is dedicated to _Venus_.
Therefore the Preparation of the Herb is in
this manner; _For spent and barren Women, and
for Coition, and for such as have a watry and thin
seed, and which cannot conceive, and such as
are withered and dry: For this is arid and delectable,
and gives Conception._ If before Coition,
you strew it on the virile Member, anointed
with Honey, the Woman will be debilitated
beyond measure. And if the Woman be so anointed,
the Intenseness of the Act will be great: For it dries up Nature, and causes Conception, and makes barren women conceive. And it is prepared thus: of _Satyrion_ Seed ℥ij.
and Seef of Pepper ℥j. _Alumen scissile_ ℥j. (_but according to another_ Book) ℥ij. _Stypleria rotunda, i.e._ common Allum ℥ij. _Aromate aridis_ ℥ij. Lay it up in a Vessel, and communicate it to no man. The Preparation, or Confection of _Aromate aridis_ is thus, _Costue_ ℥ij. Spikenard ℥β. (_in another Book_, ℥ij.) _Carpoblasamum_ ℥ iij. _Amomum_ ℥β. (in another place ℥v.) _Cloves_ ℥ij. _Cassia_ ℥ij. _Storax_ ℥v. _Opabalsamum_ ℥j. Roses exunglated ℥iiij. Musk ℈β.
Powder the dry things very finely, and sift them well. Then rub the _Storax_ a long time apart, and hten with the beaten Roses and Balsam, and all mixt together, make Trochises: Afterwards suffumigate them, and dry them in a ???, _thyinum_ of Tree-Moss and _Storax_, and Mastich (?), and Quails Claws, and _Costus_, which being dried, put them up in a Glass Vessel, and when you have occasion for Conception, powder to Trochises. And this is _Confectio aromatic sicia(?)_. And the Bird Estrich has an _Echidirum_, which is called _suffivium aridum_, the inner Skin of the Gizzard: This powdered, and given in Drink secretly, _procures Love and Luxury_. And the Stone of the _Echinus_, i.e. of the Gizzard of an Estrich, with one Grain of _Satryion_,
powdered and given in Meat or rink secretly, _procures great Intenseness to them especially, who are impotent in Coition._ And the stone it self, only hung about the Neck, _causes good Digestion, and Intenseness in Coition_. And the Stone of the right Temple of the Sea-Cow, carried about one, causes Intenseness, or Erection. And the left Stone does the contrary. And the Fat of the Fish causes great Delights, beaten up, or dissolved with Honey, and anointed on both Genitals. Engrave therefore upon a Saphire-stone an Estrich holding a Sea-Cow in its Mouth, and put underneath a grain of _Satyrium_ and a little of the Stone, which is in the _Echinus_ or Gizzard of the same Bird, and enclosing it, wear it, _against all indigestion and for Tension and Love. For it is very good for those that desire to use much Coition, and for old Men. And it makes him that wears it, gracious._



## LETTER XIX. Τ.

_Trifolium, Trefoil, a known Herb. {G},
the Peacock, a delectable and acceptable Bird,
which all do know. {G}, a Turtle, a Sea-fish
known to all, whose good and bad is known.
Taïtis, a Stone as beautiful as a Peacock, and
like one._

Engrave therefore in the Stone a Peacock,
holing a Sea-Turtle, and under the Stone
the Peacock's Voyce, _ajo_, and put the Roots
underneath. _For this carried about one is a
great Miracle for Victory and Peace, and Stability,
and all Gains; so that the very Divinity
rejoyces in it. And it shews in Sleep whatever
you would._ For if you place it under your
Head, in great rest, you shall see in a Dream
what you have a mind to. And give this
Ring to no other body. For such another
is not found. And by the Stone that is in
the Head of a Peacock, given in Drink with
your own Sweat, you may obtain any Virgin
which you have a mind to. 


## LETTER XX. Υ.

_{G}, is an Herb stupednously good; some
call it Dionysiaca,_ i.e. Bacchus _and_ Jove
_their Herb, {G}, it is a Summer
Plant._ Yperionis avis _is the Female Eagle,
like to the Male Eagle. {G}, a Sea-fish not
edible. Yenos, a Stone which is found in Rivers,
it is a Stone having a very bloody Colour._

Engrave therefore in the Stone an Eagle
tearing the Fish, and under the Stone put a
Root of the Herb, and the end of a Feather
of the Eagle's Wing, and if you
have it not, put in a Hawk's Feather,
and enclosing it, you will have a great
Phylactery _for all Fits of the Mother and
Swimmings in the Head, and Flux of Blood,
and further for all Diseases onthe Mother, excerpt
the falling down of the Womb._ Give
it therefore to Women Patients as a great Mystery.



## LETTER XXI. Φ.

_{G} is an Herb, which is called {G},
i.e. Rana, an evil Plant. The forms of it is as
opium raninum: And it grows in Waters, being
of a burning quality. {G} is a Bird; it is
of the bigness of a Sparrow. {G}, a Seal or Sea-Calf,_
viz. _an excellent Sea-Animal having
hands like a Man, a Face like a Calf or a Cow.
{G}, some call it {G}, a Toad-stone._

The Virtue of the Herb therefore is strong
as Iron, _viz. it breaks Apostemes, Kernels,
Glands, and all things that are purulent._ And
you shall cause a Plaster or Oyntment to be
laid on but for three hours, then take it away,
and you will find the Body marked
and hurt: But in the hard Bodies you may let
it lie on longer. And after incision use those
things, which cleanse and draw, and then
Healers. And thïs is the Rosary. Of the
Herb _Batrachia_ ℥iv. Arsenick ℥iv. _Chalcitis_
℥iv. _Lathyridon_ ℥iv. the Breasts of _Cantharides_,
throwing away the ings and legs ℥vj.
quick Lime ℥j. (in another place ℥viij.) Oyl
of Cedar, or Roses, or _Costus_ what is sufficient;
French Soap ℥iv. Beat them together
carefully, and make a Plaster, and lay it up
in a Glass Vessel. Use it, and take care you
lay it not upon a Nerve or Muscle, and make
a Convulsion. And it is good also for an
_Ægilops_ and _Trichiasis_, applied after they appear
to be rosen. The hairs also of a Seal
which are found between its Nose and its
Mouth, the greater and harsher of them
pluckt, with the middle of a Seal's Heart
and the Heart of a Houp, and a little of the
Liver of a Seal, and some _Chrysanthemum_ or
_Stoechas_ or herb _Plumeria_, of Ants herb, and
_lynx_, of the Tongue of an Estrich, and a little
Musk in Deer's Skin, and tie up the right
Eye of a Wolf; and keep it for a great Phylactery
_for all Friendship, and obtaining of Victory.
For it dissolves all Enmity, and confers
Friendship, it also delivers from all necessity and
difficulty of Times, and from danger, and from
all tempests and waves of the Sea, and from
wild Beasts, and from Pirate and Thieves by
Sea or Land, and from Devils and Sickness
for it affords health, and good acts, and good
works, opportunity, and abundance of all good
things, and truly it is the great Protection of
GOD,_ especially if it have the Root or
Fruit of Pæony init. And the Nails of a
Seal's hands, carried about one or worn, frustrate
all Treacheries and Fascinations. Therefore
it will not be inconvenient neither, to
put a Nail of the right hand into this Phylactery.
And the Hairs of a Seal put into an
Unguent, and tied about one in a Girdle,
cures _all pain of the Loyns and Kidneys._ Being
put also in the Shooes they cure _the
Gout and Bloody Flux._ And likewise the
Fat of a Seal, mixt with Oyntment of Roses,
is good _for Gouty persons._ And if one tie the
Heart of it to the Mast of a Ship, _the Ship will
never suffer Shipwrack._ And if you hang its
Skin at the Sayl-yard or at the Mast of a
Ship, _it will not be struck by Thunder._ And
the Bird eaten cures Icterick Persons. And
its Claws hung about one _cures the cold Fit
of a Quotidian, Tertian and Quartan Ague._
And its Heart tied in a Cloth, and worn upon
the Arms, _puts off a Tertian, and Quartan,
and an {G}._ In a Toadstone therefore
engrave a Hawk and at its feet the
Frog-Fish, and enclose the Tongue of a Frog,
and the root of the Herb, and the end of
the Tongue of the Bird, and give it
to whom you please to carry. _For it
stops all Fluxes of Blood, and cures the Jaundice.
It is also for such as spit blood, and
for the Flux of Women, and is good for the ???
of Fury above the Anger of ones Enemies,_ especially
if the hairs of a Seal be enclosed in
it. _It preserves also from venomous Stings._ And
it has other Acts also, which I shall relate.
Take the Stone, which is called _Hieracite_
and engrave in it a Hawk, and at his feet a
Frog, and under foot engrave this _M l â a â_
which is _Malae_. In another Book it is found
thus; _Mer Gys Rai maa ovaa._ And in a living
Loadstone make this Sculpture, _a a m a a G y n a_:
But other have it thus _M a a a a_.
And take a common Hawk, which we call
_Circus_, or a Falcon, kill it in Spring-water
by dipping it under water so often till it dies.
Take it therefore, and preserve it in Myr???
for seven days, as in Salt. And after seven
dayes, tie the Tongue of a living Frog, and two
stones, _scil_, a _Hieracties_ and a Magnet, and
little filings of Steel, that the Magnet, may
live, tie them in a Hawk's Skin: And make
the Ligature of the Phylactery of the nerve
of the Hawk, as round (or twisted) Co???
small and long, that being worn about the
Neck, it may reach to the Stomach and Heart
and _you will foreknow all things_. But neither
tell, nor teach this to thy own Son. _This
the Apozeme or Cup of the Phylactery_. Take a
new Flagon or Dish, in which the foresaid
Water where the Bird was killed is, and take
of that Water ℥ij. and of Honey ℥j. and of
Rosemary root ℥ij. and of Barley first infused
in Rain-water till it sprout, so that indeed
the Grain does just appear, xxviij
Corns, and of the Herb _Batrachia_ ℥iv. Frankincense ℥iv.
of the Herb _Chamæleon_ iiij Seeds,
which are called _C?idius Coccus_. Bruise them,
and boyl then with _Hydromel_, till it grow as
thick as an Electuary, and put it up in a
Glass Vessel, and keep it covered. But when
you put this up, put into it the heart of a
Houp, and its Blood; and again upon this,
swallow another heart of a Houp, and _Hydromel_
after it, and a little of the Composition,
_and you will be perfect all the time of your Life._
And it is good, if you dip the foresaid Stones
in the same Composition, and so you will provide
for your self when you want any thing,
or you shall keep a Ring so, and you will be
perfect. _When therefore you would foreknow, or
know, whatever is done in the World, or in thy
own House, or in another House, concerning a
Man or a Woman, or a Thief;_ taste first with
one finger of the Composition, and drink devoutly,
and afterwards _Hydromel_, and carry
the foresaid Phylactery about your neck, so
that it may reach your Heart and Stomach,
and you will be a Fore-knower of all things.
Whatever you have a mind to know concerning
the life of a Man or Woman, their Actions
and Generations, and Lots of Fortunes,
and concerning Thieves and Fugitives, where
and how they are; as a wise Man you shall
have Science of, and know, and discern every
thing.

coming in the Morning, take chastly a little
of it, and anoint your Face, and go away
confidently, _for it will make you amiable, and
acceptable, and efficacious with all Men, and for
all things._ And if you do this at the Sun-rising,
it will be the more effectual. _And it is good
for infortunate degrees, inefficacy and suchlike._
The Root therefore of the Herb with the
Stone out of the Fishes Head, tied in a Cloth,
_is good for pain of Childrens Teeth in breeding
them._ The Eyes of the Bird _Chrysepteris_, hung
about one, _cure Tertian Agues._ Its Hearst also
hung about the Neck cures Fevers. The

called {G},_ i.e. _Vadum._

Boyl therefore of the Seed of the Herb
℥iij. in ℥xviij. of Water to viscosity, strain it
through a Cloth, and throw away the dregs,
and in the Water which you strained out, put
of Wax ℥iij. of Oyl ℥vj. Then boyl them,
till the Wax is melted, and rub it a long time
in a Mortar. _For this is a divine Plaster for
the Gout and Stone, and insensible Flesh._ And
if you put the Stone into the Blood of the
Bird, and anoynt the Face, _you will cure Tertian
and Quartan Agues._ And if in the foresaid
Juice of the Herb you dup the Stone
thrice, and anoynt those, that have the
_Head-ach_, in the Face, _you will keep them without
pain._ And _Psyllus marinus_, tied up with
viij Seeds of _Psyllium_ in a Cloth, and hung
about the neck, _drives away a Fit of a Tertian
Ague_. And boyl a great many _Psylli marini_
in Sea-water, _and sprinkle it where there are many
Fleas, and there shall be no more._ In the
Stone _Psoricus_ engrave three _Psylli marini_,
abiding under the green Reed, and
enclose the Roots of the Herb, and
give it _to a little one to wear, that falls and
beats out his Teeth._ And if a Fisher carry it about
him watching all day by a River or
Pond, _he will make a great catching of Fish._



## LETTER XXIV. Ω.

_{G}, an edible Plant, known to all, Basil.
{G}, a Bird, Swift-wing, a venerable
Animal, common to all, {G}, a Swallow.
{G} a Sea-fish, Ibembras, another calls it Kymbros,
a small edible Animal, which is called {G},
a Pilchard or Herring. {G},_ i.e.
_velociter pariens, wuickly bearing, is a Stone less
than the Eagle-stone and ratling. And it is
smooth to the Touch._


We know of the Plant Basil, and that is has
great Effects. If any one chew this Herb fasting,
and before he have washed, and shall
set it in the open Air for seven nights, in which
time the Sun may not see it, taking it away
indeed by day, and by night exposing it to
the open Air, he will find a Scorpion of seven
knots and green. _If this stings any one,
he will swell and die in three dayes._ And if
you put it into water or wine, and give it any
one to drink, all his Body will grow dry and
leprous. For of this come incurable Ulcers.
And if you bruise the same Scorpion with the
seed of the herb _Scorpiona_, and make Pills,
afterwards dry them and put them up in a
Glass, and give them any one that is Epileptick,
he will no longer be bart. And you
must give it for seven dayes alike, three Pills
fasting, in temperate wine. But if you give
it to a healthy Man, he will grow Lunatick,
and he will be incurable. And if you anoint
_People in Tertian Agues_ with the Juice of the
herb Basil and Swallow's Dung, you will cure
them. And if you give a Swallow's Feather,
and Basil root, _to a Woman in travail to hold,
she will presently bring forth without any harm._
If you put a Feather of the Bird in any Unguent,
_you will have love and peace with all men._
And concerning the common Scorpion
I will hide nothing, because of the Error of
the Foolish. For there is an Error implanted
in the Air. If therefore you put a common
Scorpion into ℥vijβ. of Oyl in the wain of
the Moon, and keep it by you, and anoint
any ones back, and the paslms of his hands,
and the soles of his feet; but you must anoint
the back from the top to the bottom,
and the forehead, and the head before the
hour of the Fit, _it will cure a Tertian, and a
Quartan, and a Quotidian Ague. It also helps
Lunaticks, and those that are possessed with the
Devil._ But if you put a Feather of the Bird
into other Oyl, and anoint him that is cured,
his Disease will return, and he will die. And
a common Scorpion roasted and eaten by
those that have the Stone, _makes them piss the
Stone without torment._ Tie up the string of a
Scorpion, and the extremity of the Herb Basil,
in which the Seed is, and a Swallow's heart
in a Deer's skin, _and you will cure Lunaticks;
and this Phylactery both casts out disobedient
Devils, and compels them to go away._ And
dissolve the foresaid Stone with the Juice of
the Herb, and the blood of the Bird, and
the head of a Herring, and a little water,
and put it up in a Glass Vessel, and _when you
have a mind to make shew of your power,_ dip
the fingers of your hand, either right
or left, _and touch the strongest stone that you
please, or bone, or wood, it will presently break,
so that you shall seem great._ And if one puts
the head of a fresh Herring upon the Coals
to fumigate, and he gets upon the house in
the night, he will think _that all the Stars run
into one._ And if any one at the full Moon
shall put the head of the Animal into a dry
Fig, and shall lay it on the Fire, when the
Air is still he will see the Orb of the Moon
as big as half of Heaven. _Another sight;_
And if you mix a little of the Sea-star with
it, you see great _Stichius_, he is the _Dæmon
Fortune_, made, and standing at your
feet. And if you powder the Stone _Pyrites_,
and in like manner lay it on, _there will be
Thunder and Lightning._ And if you also lay
on Earth, which fell from an house upon a
Man, there will be an Earthquake in the
place. And {G} they call {G}, because it
hath great virtue in the shoulders: for {G}
is a shoulder. _And the Confection of the Plasters
is in this manner;_ Of the bones which
are in the shoulders of Herrings, Mandrake
Apples, Henbane Seed, _Opium_, dried Roses
each ℥j. (in another place Bark of the Root of
_Ulmelea_ ℥iij.) _Colophonia_ ℔j. Sulphur ℥j. Nitre
℥j. Make it as a Composition, and plaster
whom you please with it, and he will quickly
be rid of his Disease. But if you make a
Fomentation applies for one day, and would
give any relief, it will do no good. But it
will not pass seven dayes: for this is the Medicine
of things that are applied. And _Mænis_
is so called, because it makes a Maniacal
Confection in this manner, Take, I say, the
eyes of a _Mænis_, and put them into Wine
with some Lily, and infuse them so for seven
dayes, then put into the Wine of Mandrake
Seeds ℥xiv. Seeds of {G}, _i.e._ Dog-Briar
℥iv. of the Herb _Scorpionia_ ℥iv. Boyl it to
half, and put it up and use it. _For mad
People;_ If you see any one in Madness, or a
_Mania_, give him of the Wine ℥ij. with warm
water, and he will be cured (in another Book
it was ℥viij.) And if you mix it with an Eye-water,
and make an infusion, and use it for
seven dayes _in a suffusion of the Eyes,_ it will
cure. And the Stones, that are in the head
of a _Mænis_, powdered and mixt with the
gall of a black _Alanitus, make one to see these
things that are in the dark._ And if you mix
it with a little of living Magnet, and a little
Rain-water, and anoint, _you will see these
things that are in the Heaven and in the Air for
seven days._ Engrave on the Stone a Swallow,
and at its Feet a Scorpion, standing upon
a Herring, and under the Stone enclose
the eyes of a Scorpion, and a Herring, and
the Roots of _Scorpionia_, and wear it. _For it
averts all venom of Animals, and will humble
all Enemies and Traytors._ If any one be stung
by a Scorpion, sign the Wound with the
Seal, and presently he will be cured. If any
one be _bitten by a mad Dog,_ and grow {G},
he cannot drink a more precious
Liquor. Take therefore the Ring, and put
it in Water, and give him to drink, and he
will be safe; and if you give it before Madness,
he will not be mad. And if one give
the Tongue of a young _Mænis_ dissolved in
water, and putting the Ring into it, give it
a mad man to drink, he will be safe. But if
you give it to one that is sober, it will make
him raging mad. His Relief is, to give him a
roasted _Mænis_ to eat, and the man will become
ignorant of the foresaid things. _As
Divine_ Kiranides _sayes unto Men._

_Thus_ Harpocration _finished this Book, and I
found no other Book of them that are called_
Kirandes. _But indeed in this, I say,_ Harpocration
_was dissonant from_ Kirani, _or the
one from the other: But we collected every
Chapter out of each, as if set down, and we
have made a Book, omitting nothing. And
now we will pass to the other Books of_ Kirani,
_that we may reap benefit by them._
