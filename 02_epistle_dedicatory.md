I Admire and commend the sigacity of
Your Prudence, who, tho' You be experienced
in such things as are above the Nature of our Sphere, and have
by Contemplation penetrated to things beyond
the Seventh Heaven; yet you disdain
not to look down upon the most inferiour
terrene Experiments: For You requested me
to translate this Physick Book out of the
Greek into the Latine Tongue: a thing much
more easily said than done. However, being
obliged by your Charity and Bounty to me,
I could not disobey your Commands. And
because there are, as you know, _divers Translations
out of the_ Agarene _Tongue into the Greek_,
I have industriously and faithfully followed
the Greek Book that you gave me, in all
things. Neither was I willing to pass by the
very two Prologues, tho' rugged, and abstracted,
as it were, from the most ancient
Titles: not so much minding the Words,
which are of a Barbarian Sterility, as the
Sense of Utility. If therefore you find any
thing altered, let it not be imputed to my
Unfaithfulness or Ill-will, but to common
Mistake: _For there is no man so wise, but has
some Mark of Folly in him._ Yet I would
have you know, that there is among the
_Grecians_ a certain _Book of_ Alexander _the
Great about the seven Herbs of the seven Planets,_
and another that is called _Thessala his
Mystery to_ Hermes (that is, _Mercury_) _of the
twelve Herbs attributed to the twelve Signs, and
of seven other Herbs by seven other Stars._
Which, if they should happen to come to my
hands or to yours, because they imitate a
Celestial Dignity, may very well be prefixt to
this work.

This Book therefore is translated at _Constantinople,
Manuel_ being Emperor, _Anno
Christi 1168. Indictione secundá_. _The Book of
Physical Virtues, Sympathies, and Cures, gathered
out of two Books,_ viz. _The Experience of_
Kiranides Kirani, _King of the_ Persians, _and
out of the Book of_ Harpocration _the_ Alexandrian
_to his own Daughter_. And the first Book
of _Kirani_ was thus, and so we will suppose
it was the great Gift of the _Agarene_ to him.
He that received this Book from GOD, was
_Hermes Trismegistus_, well known to all men.
Do not therefore deliver it to the Ignorant,
but keep it to thy self as a great Possession:
and let the Father, if it may so be, deliver
it only to his Children instead of Gold for
the efficacy of its Action, adjuring them, as
sacred Children, only to keep it secret.

This Book was engraven in _Syriack_ Letters
upon an Iron Pillar, in a Book indeed interpreted
by me formerly. But in this Book
which is called _Kiranides_, _twenty four Stones,
twenty four Fishes, twenty four Herbs, and
twenty four Birds are written of._ The Virtues
of every one of these are complex and
intermixt with the rest, for the Cure, and also
the Delight of mortal Bodies: And truly
the invention or beginning is from Almighty
GOD; for by his Wisdom we obtain the Action
of Herbs, Fishes and Birds, and the Virtue
of Stones, and the Nature of Animals and
wild Beasts, and moreover, the mutual permixtions
of them, and their Communities and
Proprieties, since the knowledge & skill of many
things comes from GOD into men. Therefore
dividing into three _Kiranides_; I have
declared the whole Composure in order of the
Alphabet, according as any thing worthy
Remarque occurred. And they are called
{G}, (_Koiranides_ or Queens) because
these are the Queens of all the rest of my
Books. And we found _Kirani_ of the King
of the _Persians_, which is the first of these
Books.

This indeed is the Prologue of _Harpocration_,
and it is thus;

_The Therapeutick_ (that is, the Curatory)
Book of Syria, Harpocration wrote it to his
own Daughter. When formerly I travelled through the
Country of _Babylon_, I found a City, _Seleutica_
by Name, the History whereof I have
written; but we have no occasion to make
any long Discourse upon that City, because
we would not alwayes be upon Preambles.
Now therefore let us return to our proposed
Intention. Then, says he, I saw another City
yet, seventeen _Persian_ Miles distance from
_Seleutica_, which _Alexander of Macedon_ demolished;
afterwards _Seleutica_ was built, under
the Dominion of the _Persians_, and inhabited
by the Nation of the Persians. This is called
little _Alexandria_, which is near _Babylon_. And
this is the History of Syria,

The third Year it happened, that I found
an old man skill'd in Foreign Learning, and
in the Greek Tongue: But he said, he was a
_Syrian_ by Nation, was taken captive, and
lived there: and he went round the
City with me, and shewed me every thing.
And when we came to a certain place about
four Miles distance from the City, we saw a
Pillar, with a great Tower, which the Inhabitants
of Syria said they brought from the
Ædifice of _Solomon_, and placed it there for
the Health and Cure of the Men of that City.
Looking therefore well upon it, I found it
was written in strange Letters. The old
Man therefore; assoon as he was asked by
me, agreed to shew me, and I willingly lent
an ear to him, while he discoursed, and expounded
the Barbarous Letters that were upon
the Pillar in the Æolick Tongue. My
Son, saith he, You see three Towers standing
here, one of which is five Miles distant,
another two and a half, and another four.
These were built by the Giants, who had a
mind to climb into Heaven; for this their impious
Madness some of them were struck with
Thunder, others through the just Judgment
of GOD, knew not themselves, and the rest
were cast into the Isle of Crete, into which,
God, being angry with them, hurled them.
The old Man therefore, who shewed me these
things, bade me measure the greatness of the
Stone with a Cord: Therefore measuring
that which was nigh, I found it two and
thirty Cubits high, and seventy nine broad;
and there were two hundred and eight steps
to it. We also saw a Sacred Cloyster, and in
the middle of the Cloyster there was a Temple,
having three hundred sixty five Silver
Steps, and sixty more of Gold, by which we
went up to pray to GOD. And he told me
the Mysteries of the Living GOD, which I
will not tell to all. I was indeed willing to
be informed of other things, and propounded
several other things; but my main design
was to be informed of the Pillar: And the
old Man drawing aside a Silken Veil, shewed
strange and foreign Letters engraven upon it.
And because he was skilled in my Tongue, I
entreated and begged of him, that he would
candidly and without Envy make plain all
things to me. Now the Things that were
read upon the Pillar, were these;

_This is a manifold Table of the irue Example,
alwayes having, and knowing, and fore-knowing
the Immissions of the Divinity._

This Second Book may in the Name of
GOD be called _Kirani_. _The Second Book going
out of the little_ Archaicus Syriacus, as the
clear Flood of _Euphrates_ runs swiftly. _These
Things were engraven on Iron Pillars._ “Both
whatever things were formerly, or shall be
hereafter, equal Conjunctions of them in
Virtues of Stones, and with them also both
the Plants of the Earth, and the Fishes of
the Deep, and the Fowls of the Air, tempering
Virtue with Virtue in the greater
Quaternary: For these things are good for
Men that were formerly, and shall be hereafter;
because being immortal bearing a
mortal Body, carried through the Air,
bound with the evil Bonds of Necessity; as
GOD himself said, governing mortal Bodies,
thou art made in Sin, and encompassed
with the sordidness of Necessity, as any
one in Fetters, unless he get out, and in
Bonds and Chains; so Necessity straitens
thee in hard Bonds: But when thou art got
out of the dull Body, thou shalt truly see
GOD, that rules in the Air and in the Cloud,
who causes Thunder and Earthquake,
Lightning and Thunder-bolts, and who
shakes the Foundations of the Earth, and
the Waters of the Sea. These are the Works
of GOD the Father Eternal. O Soul
GOD shews these things, and all Contraries.”

But this Book was buried in the Fens of
_Syria_, engraven upon an Iron Pillar all over
Steel or Endanick, as we said before in the
former Book, which is called _Archaicus_: But
in this, that is called _Kiranides_, four and
twenty Stones, four and twenty Fishes of the
Sea, four and twenty Herbs, and four and
twenty Birds are written of, The Virtue of
every one of these shall be complicate and
mixt with the other Virtues, that asswaging
and strengthening this mortal Body, we may
enjoy Health Eternal: _For none gives Spirit to
Man but GOD_; for all things are written
according to the Construction of GOD:
And this is the Beginning. For tho' the Beginnings
or Prologues of each have a Dissonance;
yet henceforth they begin as it were
in Consonance. And Harpocration sayes thus.
