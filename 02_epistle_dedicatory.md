obliged by your Charity and Bounty to me, I could not diſobey your Commands. And
becauſe there are,as you know, divers Tranſla tions out of the Agarene Tongue into the Greek, I have induſtriouſly and faithfully followed the Greek Book that you gave me, in all things. Neither was I willing to paſs by the very two Prologues, tho' rugged, and ab ſtraćted, as it were, from the moſt ancient Titles: not ſo much minding the Words, which are of a Barbarian Sterility, as the Senſe of Utility. If therefore you find any thing altered, let it not be imputed to my Unfaithfulneſs or Ill-will, but to common
Miſtake: For there is mo man ſo wiſe, but has Jome Mark of Folly in him. Yet I would have you know, that there is among the Grecians a certain Book of Alexander the Great about the ſeven Herbs of the ſeven Pla mets, and another that is called Theſſala his
Myſtery to Hermes (that is, Mercury) of the twelve Herbſ attributed to the twelve Signs, and of ſeven other Herbſ by ſeven other Stars. Which, if they ſhould happen to come to my hands or to yours, becauſe they imitate a

The Therapeutick (that is, the Curatory) Book of Syria, Harpocration wrote it to his
own Daughter. When formerly I travelled through the Country of Babylon, I found a City, Seleu tica by Name, the Hiſtory whereof I have written; but we have no occaſion to make
any long Diſcourſe upon that City, becauſe
we would not alwayes be upon Preambles. Now therefore let us return to our propoſed Intention. Then, ſays he, I ſaw another City yet, ſeventeen Perſian Miles diſtance from Seleutica, which Alexander of Macedon deno

Syrian by Nation, was taken captive, and lived there: and he went round the
City with me, and ſhewed me every thing. And when we came to a certain place about four Miles diſtance from the City, we ſaw a
Pillar, with a great Tower, which the Inha bitants of Syria ſaid they brought from the AEdifice of Solomon, and placed it there for the Health and Cure of the Men of that City. Looking therefore well upon it, I found it was written in ſtrange Letters. The old Man therefore; aſſoon as he was asked by me, agreed to ſhew me, and I willingly lent an ear to him, while he diſcourſed, and ex pounded the Barbarous Letters that were up on the Pillar in the Æolick Tongue. My Son, ſaith he, You ſee three Towers ſtand

will not tell to all. I was indeed willing to beinformed of other things, and propounded ſeveral other things; but my main deſign was to be informed of the Pillar : And the
